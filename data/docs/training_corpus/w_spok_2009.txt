Barack Obama has been all over Washington these last two weeks . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) But the president-elect was formally welcomed to the Capitol last night when his vintage train pulled into Union Station just before 7:00 . Obama began the day , Michelle Obama ' s 45th birthday in Philadelphia . Stopped in Wilmington to pick up the Bidens. @!SENATOR-JOSEPH-BID# Happy birthday , kids . Welcome to Wilmington . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) Then they rolled slowly south emulating Abe Lincoln 's inaugural train ride and echoing Lincoln 's words . @!BARACK-OBAMA-@1PRE# An appeal not to our easy instincts but to our better angels . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) The cold did not chill the crowd 's good clear and they are not alone . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) A new ABC News poll out this morning shows that 80% of Americans approve of how Obama ' s handled the transition . And 79% just like him . The last incoming president with support like that was Ronald Reagan in 1981. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) All that is happy news for our headliner this morning , David Axelrod . Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So , you 're going into the White House on Tuesday with the public rooting for you . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Yeah , I think the public is rooting for us . And more importantly , rooting for the country . We know - I think everybody knows we have big problems . I think the striking thing about your poll and all the polling I 've seen is this combination of optimism and realism . People are hopeful about the future but they understand we have really serious problems . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And I want to talk about how do you get the balance right . Because , as our poll , as you say , people are pretty realistic , also pretty upset . 94% say the economy is in bad shape . That is as bad as we 've ever seen . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# I want to find the 6% who think it 's in good shape . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , exactly . But the president-elect , in all of his policy speeches , over the last couple weeks , keeps on saying it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's based on briefings . What exactly do you know and what should people expect ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , look we - obviously , the reason that he came here two weeks early was to begin work on an economic recovery package . But any economist will tell you that even if we move rapidly , it takes a little while for this to move through the system and to put the brakes on what is the most serious economic downturn we 've had in many , many generations . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So are we talking double-digit unemployment ? A year-long recession another year ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# That 's what we 're trying to avoid , George , is double-digit unemployment . We 're trying to take some measures that will create 3 million to 4 million jobs the next couple of years to put - to try and slow down this plummeting employment . And I think we can do that . But I think it 's fair to say that it 's going to take not months , but years to really turn this around . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation potential of this plan . Senator Kent Conrad , the chairman of the Budget Committee was on Bloomberg News just the other day . And he said he does n't think you 're gon na be able to create the kind of jobs you 're talking about . Take a look . @!SENATOR-KENT-CONRA# I have my doubts . I do n't think - you know , most of the assessment is that this will reduce unemployment from what it would otherwise be by 2% . My people 's analysis suggests maybe only half of that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Are you over promising ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , look , I do n't think - first of all , his people and our people may have some dispute and we 'll find out what the truth is . But here 's where we are . We have to act . We have to try . It 's not enough to be a doubter . It 's not enough to question . Not when we 're in the situation we 're in . We believe that this is a well-conceived approach to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful to have to do in terms of our debt . But it 's something that we have to do , or we run the risk of that scenario that you suggest , double-digit unemployment . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Senator Conrad is sill signaling that he 's going to support the plan . But Republicans are expressing even more doubts and more criticism , even though I know the president-elect wants to get significant Republican support . The House Republican Leader John Boehner was out the other day and he said that his side was not even consulted on the preparation of the package that 's going to be put forward in the House . @!REPRESENTATIVE-JOH# Oh , my god . I - I do n't even - my notes here say that I 'm disappointed . I just ca n't tell you how shocked I am at what we 're seeing . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He says this is going to lead to another era of borrow and spend and not going to produce the jobs you talk about . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , with all due respect to Congressman Boehner and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work across the aisle , but one - he ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Why not consult with them on the package , though ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , there have been consultations , George . And there will continue to be consultations . But let 's remember why we 're in the mess we 're in . Part of it is that when the Clinton administration left office , we were running record surpluses , and the policies that were put in place doubled our debt in a matter of a few years . And I did n't hear some of the voices who are speaking out now moralizing about that then . So , we ought to put all of the politics aside and do what 's best for the country . Right now , the country 's in an economic emergency and we need to act . And I do n't think the people are going to have the tolerance for the kind of customary Washington . Now , having said that , I think there are legitimate discussions to have . The president-elect has said , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone tablets . I mean , he 's coming there to have a consultation and to come up with the best possible program . So we 're going to consider all of these facts but let 's not engage in the kind of political back and forth that has bogged us down so much in the past . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The other substantive point that Boehner makes , he circulated a fact sheet , he says if you look at an $825 billion piece of legislation , 3 million jobs , that 's $275,000 a job . Is that the most efficient way to create jobs ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# George , he 's missing the fundamental point . We 're not just spending money to create jobs , we 're investing money to strengthen this economy . We 're investing in areas like energy independence . We 're investing in creating the classrooms of the 21st Century for our kids to give us the kind of education system we need . We 're investing in computerizing the health care records of this country so that we can reduce costs and improve care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we 've been very careful about that . We 're not being frivolous . We 're being thoughtful about how we make these investments . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But you would concede , $275,000 a job is a high price to pay , is n't it ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , I 'm not signing on to that particular figure . I think preventing this country from sliding into as deep an economic emergency as we 've seen since the Great Depression , preventing double-digit unemployment , and laying the groundwork for the future in these areas that I mentioned and others , I think , is a worthy thing to do . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The president-elect has called for a national day of service tomorrow . And some of your allies have said you can really put some meat behind that at about $25,000 a job by greatly expanding public service opportunities like Americorp the way FDR did with the Civilian Conservation Corps . Why not put that in the package ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , we will be expanding service programs . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) In this legislation ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in this legislation . But we 're going to do it and we 're gon na greatly increase our efforts to involve people at local grassroots level in service projects . But this is a situation where the impetus has to come from the government . Only the government can martial the resources to really blast us out of the morass we 're in right now . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And part of that morass , of course , is the cascading failures of the banks that we 've seen over the last several weeks and months . Even last week . And there were reports this weekend in the newspapers that your team is now considering going back to the original TARP approach , the original rescue approach where you buy up all the toxic assets of the banks , put them in a government agency . Get them out of the banks once and for all . And that 's going to be the only way to get confidence back in the banking system . Is that what the president wants to do ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to administer the TARP . Our team will be discussing those details in the days after Tuesday . But I think it 's clear that it has to be administered in a much different way . First of all , the point is to get credit flowing again to businesses and to families across the country . That has n't happened with the expenditure of the first $350 billion . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And following up on that Tom Friedman of " The New York Times " today says that the president , as soon as he gets into office should call in the 300 top bankers in country into the east room and basically read them the riot act and tell them to get lending again . Will you follow that advice ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , I think he 's going to have a strong message for the bankers . We 're not - we want to see credit flowing again . We do n't want them to sit on any money that they get from taxpayers . And the other things that we have to deal with is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money went and how it was spent . It 's not easy to follow even for people in government . And we have to deal with that . We have to begin to address the housing issue in a way it has n't been addressed yet . So there are a lot of things that have to be done differently . And we have to make sure that the money does n't go to excessive CEO pay and dividends when it should be going to lending . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The man you want to administer this , of course , is Tim Geithner , president-elect Obama ' s choice for treasury secretary . Revealed this week that he did n't pay about $34,000 in back taxes when he was working at the IMF . What do you say to Americans who say it just does n't seem right that the person who 's going to be overseeing the Internal Revenue Service did n't pay $34,000 in back taxes ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , he paid those taxes , George , when it was pointed out he had made a mistake on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was overseas serving our country in the IMF , was a common - everyone agrees it 's a common mistake that people working overseas make . He 's corrected it . I think when people look at Tim Geithner though , they should look at a guy who 's devoted his life to public service , who was an integral part of solving another international financial crisis in the ' 90s and has vast experience and great insights . He is precisely the kind of person we need in the treasury right now . And I think when people get to know him - and he 's going to testify this week , I think he 's going to inspire great confidence . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Confident he 'll be confirmed ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# I am confident . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let 's look ahead to the inaugural speech . I know you have been working with the president-elect on that . He and Michelle were asked about that yesterday on the train trip . @!BARACK-OBAMA-@1PRE# She 's heard me speak before . She wants to hear some of the concerts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really good so I 'm looking forward to it . @!BARACK-OBAMA-@1PRE# Shh , that 's not what you 're supposed to say in front of the press . @!MICHELLE-OBAMA-@1W# Oh , I 'm sorry . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Now , I know you 're not going to make that mistake . You 're well qualified in setting expectations . But if you can just give us a sense , did we really see the president hitting the themes yesterday on the train trip that he 's going to hit in the inaugural ? And is the animating theme of the speech responsibility ? Everyone in the country is going to have to take responsibility for our future ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well that - you know , George , one thing about Barack Obama is his themes have been consistent not just through this campaign but through his public life , from his convention speech in 2004 through today . So I do n't think you 're going to be surprised by what you hear . I think he 's going to talk about where we are as a country but also who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us as a result of that . And what we have to do to move forward . So , I 'm not going to handicap whether it 's going to be a great speech , a good speech . But I have confidence in the message that he wants to deliver . And I do n't think you 'll be surprised by it . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Finally , on Wednesday morning , the president - the next president will call in his military commanders . Will he ask them as he promised in the campaign to come back with a plan to withdraw American forces from Iraq in 16 months ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Well , that was something that he 's consistently said . He believes that that is a reasonable timetable . We 've moved a great distance from the time he started talking about that . And now , we 're in an area where everyone agrees that we should be on a path to withdrawing those troops . And he is going to begin that process as promised on that day . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He 'll give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks very much . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1IN# Okay . Great to be with you , George . ' 
##4030952 @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , the final touches are being put on what will be a historic presidential inauguration just four days from now . Millions are expected in Washington to celebrate the swearing in of a politician who has truly achieved superstar status . So perhaps it 's no surprise that the business of Obama memorabilia is booming . And plenty are eager to cash in . You might call it a cottage industry if it were n't so big , as John Donvan reports . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) You think the inauguration is going to be big here in Washington where they 're rushing to get things together before Tuesday ? Well , try going 125 miles north to Westchester , Pennsylvania , at the world headquarters of QVC . The retail network that has put itself on the map selling everything from jewelry ... @!HOST-@1QVC@2-# These have a little bit of a diamond-cut pattern . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... to skin care ... @!HOST-@1QVC@2-# We have our age-defying targeted wrinkle treatment . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... to handbags ... @!HOST-@1QVC@2-# But this is the double pocket tote . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now this is a QVC exclusive . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... and Obama bronze medallions ... @!HOST-@1QVC@2-# The first presidential coin for the 44th president of the United States . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... and Obama newspaper portfolios . @!HOST-@1QVC@2-# This is the kind of thing that people will remember for generations to come . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) At QVC , this Obama thing is big . @!LEAH-WILLIAMS-@1QV# And what 's fascinating I think , people who would not necessarily consider themselves collectors in the traditional sense of the word really are interested in having a piece of history . @!DOUG-ROSE-@1VP-OF-# We think the emotion is absolutely why we want to be part of this event . It 's a historic moment for America , for the world . And we think that we 're doing our job to be part of it . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But it 's not just about history and emotions . It 's also about money . @!LEAH-WILLIAMS-@1QV# These are actual currencies . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Price tag on this ? $48.96. $54.12. $58.68. @!DOUG-ROSE-@1VP-OF-# We expect well over 200,000 Americans to have made at least one purchase of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls around . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Usually Mike Wordell 's company sells sports memorabilia , but right now it 's selling Obama items with QVC. @!MIKE-WORDELL-@1SEL# Well , we saw a niche . Barack Obama brought out more voters than any other election in the history of the United States . He brought out more young voters , more minority voters . So we saw a market that people want to collect Barack Obama . He 's more than just a president , it 's pop culture . He 's more or less a rock star . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And it 's not just QVC . Never in living memory has a presidency been preceded by such a proliferation of mass produced political paraphernalia or to use the more correct term , memorabilia or in this case Obamabilia. @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# People all over America are sending us stuff to sell . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Meet Jim Warlick. @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# Very good stuff , some of it . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) As a kid he began collecting campaign buttons . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# I have always wanted a button wall filled with buttons . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust , mouse pads , the tapes and the books . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Including this one just a few blocks from the White House where he even has a mock oval office in the entrance for snapshots. @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# Perfect . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) It 's a beautiful spring day . Hey , hi , how you doing ? A beautiful spring day outside . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# It is. @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) His store right now is attracting a flow of customers that even he can not believe . And at the cash registers numbers are ringing up that most retailers these days could only dream of . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# 28 years of doing and selling collectibles here in Washington , DC . I have never seen anything like this . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) He walked us around his place . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# Cuff links . Jewelry . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) These go for $40. @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# Obama bobblehead doll . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Which goes for $30. @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# A limited edition champagne with Obama and the campaign logo . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) That will run you 300 bucks . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# Watches , coins . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The variety of things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# And you can look through the bottom of it and look over people 's heads and see the parade . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And of course there are the t-shirts and the buttons and the glassware and the plates . But that 's not groundbreaking stuff , so how about this ? @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# We say Obama is so good for us so far that we actually print up $1 bills and sell them for $10. @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Or what about this ? @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) These are creepy . @!JIM-WARLICK-@1RETA# They are . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) These are a little creepy , yeah . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) By the end of next week , Jim expects he 'll have sold a total of 1.5 million items , a lot of stuff and yet there 's one thing here you 're not gon na find much of . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I look around , poor Joe Biden . There 's nothing . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Now Jim conceded that a lot of this Americana is actually made in China . But I smuggled in something that was made in the USA . This Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? I 'll tell you where I got it . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Where I got it was a few blocks away at what was essentially the Obama for president campaign , but is now the presidential inaugural committee . @!LINDA-DOUGLASS-@1I# We 're scrambling to come up with enough merchandise to keep the store full enough . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And here everything is made in the USA . They 've already made 30,000 sales here and on their website. @!LINDA-DOUGLASS-@1I# It 's the inaugural seal that brings people here because they understand the difference between the things you can buy on the street and the things that are , you know , produced by the presidential inaugural committee . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Linda Douglass was Obama ' s spokeswoman during the election and a former ABC News correspondent . She showed me some very high-end items here . @!LINDA-DOUGLASS-@1I# We have china for sale because people love to collect these . And you can see these are rimmed in gold and these are $82. @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The bells are $35. @!LINDA-DOUGLASS-@1I# $35 . This is a rug that you can put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $150 , they 're selling too . This is a tote bag that is designed by Diane von Furstenberg . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) $70 by the way . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Are you hearing anybody raise questions about whether it 's appropriate or tacky for the inaugural committee to be getting into the business this way ? @!LINDA-DOUGLASS-@1I# Well , we have to raise funds in a number of different ways . This inauguration is going to be very , very expensive because we are creating so many ways for people for the first time to participate for free . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Naturally here in this shop there are items listed as being limited editions . Now , speaking of the word limited , have you seen this infomercial. @!NARRATOR-@1COMMERC# This issue has been strictly limited to just 65 firing days . After that , the die will be destroyed forever . Due to the unprecedented demand there 's a strict limit of two victory plates per caller . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Seemingly a bargain at $19.99 each . @!NARRATOR-@1COMMERC# Yes , you can own a piece of history . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come sales are going to exceed the sales of the ped-egg this year . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) AJ Khubani , CEO of Telebrands , the same man behind gadgets like the ped-egg and to go-buster. @!ACTRESS-@1COMMERCI# It 's fast , it 's easy and it 's fun . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The stick up light bulb . @!ACTOR-@1COMMERCIAL# The stick up bulb is shatter proof if you drop it . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And now the historic Obama victory plate . @!NARRATOR-@1COMMERC# His confident smile and kind eyes are an inspiration to us all . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Oh , and that line about eyes and smile ? @!AJ-KHUBANI-@1CEO-# Kind eyes . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) AJ wrote it himself . @!AJ-KHUBANI-@1CEO-# His eyes are very happy and very kind . And I thought we needed to just relay that . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And when they say the production is strictly limited , how many plates are they actually talking about ? 100 ? 1,000 ? 10,000 ? @!AJ-KHUBANI-@1CEO-# We limited the edition to 65 firing days , which came out to roughly 1 million pieces . @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# There 's a general rule we like to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hate to break it to you . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) That 's so harsh . @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# But it 's so true . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Larry Bird knows something about collecting . At the Smithsonian Institute , he is curator of political memorabilia . Here in the board room , he brought out some truly collectible and historical items . @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# These are little clothing buttons that were made to commemorate the inauguration of George Washington ... @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Wow . @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# ... in 1789. @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# @(Voiceover) In a way these pieces are literally priceless , but what about the Obama memorabilia that in fact Bird had already started collecting for the museum 's archives ? Hey , my yo-yo is in there . Now , is that an investment ? @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# If you 're looking at this as an investment strategy , you probably - you should be looking elsewhere . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Sadly , probably none of this Obama stuff will ever make the people who are buying it rich . On the other hand , the people selling it - well , remember this ? @!NARRATOR-@1COMMERC# His confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . In revenue that 's almost $14 million . But for people who are buying this stuff up it 's not really about an investment anyway , it is ? @!LARRY-BIRD-@1CURAT# People so desperately want to participate in something that they feel is maybe perhaps larger than they are . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And we heard that also . With met Voe Talley shopping for plates at Political Americana the other day . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So getting it , having it is like participating . @!VOE-TALLEY-@1SHOPP# Right . And I want to get something that I 'll be able to keep . A coin you 'll be able to . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But not eat off of . I mean ... @!VOE-TALLEY-@1SHOPP# @(Voiceover) Absolutely not . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ... this goes on the wall . @!VOE-TALLEY-@1SHOPP# Right in the china closet . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Okay . @!MIKE-WORDELL-@1SEL# You can capture that history and have it forever in this framed piece . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And so at QVC they know that 's the selling point . @!LEAH-WILLIAMS-@1QV# How neat to be able to have something that commemorates that . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an inaugural ball next week . @!LEAH-WILLIAMS-@1QV# We will be decked out in our inaugural gala finery if you will . Black tie and formal wear . @!DOUG-ROSE-@1VP-OF-# If you 're moved by something you see , you 're always welcome , of course , to place an order . @!JOHN-DONVAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Of course , you do n't have to buy something to feel like a part of history . You really just have to live it , which arguably all of us will be doing next week just by watching . I 'm John Donvan for " Nightline " in Washington . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And , you know , those memories might be the best collector 's items you can find . Our thanks to John Donvan. @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) When we come back , father and son princes cause a royal backlash , but are they racist or just rude ? @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# ANNOUNCER " Nightline " continues from New York City with Terry Moran .

##4030953 @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Tonight , 155 people are counting their blessings , all of them rescued from an airliner , bobbing up and down in the swift current of New York 's Hudson River . What was it like to come that close to death ? @!JOHN-STOSSEL-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Tonight , Jim Avila brings you new voices , new stories , and dramatic moment-by-moment account of that plane skimming across the Hudson River and setting down perfectly . What might have been a disaster turned out to be an amazing experience . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) It was a good day to fly in New York . The snow showers had cleared . And now , sunlight poured into the windows of US Air Flight 1549 . Destination , Charlotte , North Carolina . Matt Kane , a salesman from Bridgeport , Connecticut , was in seat 24A , three rows from the tail . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# Yeah , it was a normal takeoff , like any other takeoff I 've had before . There were a couple of bumps here and there , but nothing major . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) But as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the 155 passengers on board felt a sudden jolt. @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# And then , from there , you heard a pop , explosion almost , and it rocked the plane . And then , I looked out , and again , I had my vantage point where I could see the , see the wing , and I saw fire coming out of the left engine . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) The plane , now just about to cross into New Jersey , began banking to the left , south towards Manhattan and 3,000 feet over the Hudson River . Irina Levshina , a New Yorker on the way to visit friends , was shaking in window seat 26A , the last row . @!IRINA-LEVSHINA-@1P# We 're just sitting there , actually praying , you know , just so hard that we would get out of this ordeal unharmed. @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Both engines flamed out , the pilots radioed the control tower they had struck a flock of geese . It was suddenly very quiet in the air . @!BRONX-RESIDENT-@1M# Oh , my God . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# A Bronx man with a cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as it begins to descend . On board , passengers already knew this was not just turbulence . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# Everyone just kind of sitting there looking at each other , and they said , you know , brace yourself . That 's when you said to yourself , this is , this is as real as anything could ever be . @!IRINA-LEVSHINA-@1P# I honestly was expecting to hit the ground and just explode and die instantaneously . So , I was just thinking , ' This is it . Three seconds from now , I 'm gon na be dead . " @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Irina did n't know she was above the Hudson River , by this time , passing just 900 feet above the George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey and New York . Matt Kane could see they were over water and losing altitude . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# I knew what he was doing . I knew he was putting it down in the water .

Could n't get reception . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Critical decisions were being made in the cockpit . Does the plane have enough speed and altitude to make it to a small airport in New Jersey ? Because if it does n't , metal against concrete , as seen in this Sioux City United Airlines crash that killed 150 , can lead to an explosion . But a water landing carries its own risks . Was the river below smooth enough to attempt what 's called ditching in the aviation world ? Were there any hazards ahead ? @!JUSTIN-GREEN-@1AVI# Ice would have been a , a bigger problem for this aircraft than it was for the Titanic . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot . The A320 is equipped with a switch designed to slam the valves , vents and ports on the underside of the fuselage close , turning the plane into a smooth bottomed boat . @!JUSTIN-GREEN-@1AVI# In a water landing , you 're not gon na drop the gear and you 're basically gon na come in in a little bit of a flatter ... @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Off-camera) So , you really just wan na skid along the water ? @!JUSTIN-GREEN-@1AVI# Skid along , yeah , skid along the water at a , as , as relatively slow in airspeed. @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Slow , in aviation terms , still means more than 100 miles an hour . And from nearby apartment buildings , spectators watched the unthinkable . Neal Lasher could not believe what he was seeing from the New Jersey side of the river . @!NEIL-LASHER-@1SPEC# To see it happening in front of my eyes , I says , ' Oh , my God . I do n't believe this , " that I knew it was n't hitting any buildings , but that 9/11 feeling I had , that - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting buildings , going , I knew it was n't that , but there was a similar feeling of , ' Oh , my God . " And I did n't know if the plane was gon na blow up , sink , dive in the water . And - I just did n't know . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) There was reason to worry . Water landings are not easy and not a pilot 's first choice during an emergency . @!JUSTIN-GREEN-@1AVI# You usually wan na put it on , in a safe landing position . Generally , the criteria is any runway . You honestly do n't know what 's gon na happen once you hit the water . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) August 2005 , an Italian commuter plane attempted to ditch off the coast of Sicily , tearing into three pieces on impact and killing half the passengers on board . And in November of 1996 , this Ethiopian airliner , a Boeing 767 , was hijacked and its pilot forced to attempt a ditch in the Indian Ocean . 123 people died when the fuselage broke , again , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Chelsey B.

And I was just hoping that it would n't be a painful death . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) And then , the jet hit the water , captured in this moment of impact still photo . @!IRINA-LEVSHINA-@1P# Wow . I 'm alive . And then , once the plane hit the water , it was relatively violent impact . It was n't horrendous , but , you know , you could really feel it , and I think I hit my head on the seat in front of me , and the plane was shaking . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) From the riverside offices , staffers of the syndicated program ' Inside Edition , " watched the crash and quickly rolled cameras , capturing the first video of the plane bobbing and drifting in the cold current of the Hudson . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) For Matt Kane , surviving the crash was just step one . Now , he had to get out of the plane and to safety . A poor swimmer , he gathered a life vest and a seat cushion , and let others go first . He was 14 rows from the exit . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# And people were panicking to a point . People were very concerned about getting children and women out first . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Off-camera) How do you resist the temptation , you 're a big , strong guy ... @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# Yeah . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Off-camera) ... to push your way through ? @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# It 's not about me , it 's about others . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) He was the last passenger out . Water was filling the tail section . And just as he reached the exit , in the middle of the plane , drenched to the waist , he looked ahead and saw the captain . @!MATT-KANE-@1PASSEN# He was waving to me , ' Come on , come up front , come up front .

He put us right in front of the wing so that people could come up , up , almost up to the ferry , and you know , we were just pulling them up . @!JIM-AVILA-@1-ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Some did panic and jumped into the water before the boats arrived .

But he left the show suddenly . He said he had mercury poisoning from eating too much fish , and the result was a storm of skepticism . Some people scoffing at it , talking about sushi . He 's gon na answer this in a moment . But we wan na say that there is an FDA advisory , there are guidelines about how much of some kinds of fish you 're supposed to eat , swordfish , albacore tuna , and we 'll review those for you in a moment .

On December 17th , after less than two months in the play , Jeremy Piven suddenly left , saying he had mercury poisoning caused by a diet heavy in fish , maybe tainted herbal supplements from China . Said he could n't stay awake . @!DR-CARLO-M-COLKER-# The bottom line is this mercury is toxic to the body . His levels in the beginning were almost six-times the upper limit of the allowable reference range . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) His doctor backing him up . Though other doctors are skeptical that even an elevated level of mercury often causes poisoning . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!DOCTOR-MARIE-SAVAR# @(Off-camera) Mercury poisoning is very unusual .

Let 's dive right into it . @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Yes . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I hear so many people saying , ' mercury - too much fish ? " @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Yeah . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) ' Sushi defense here ? " What is it ? Is it true ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Yeah . It is true . And I felt the same way . I had no reference for it whatsoever . The first week of rehearsal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference for . I went to the doctor . He tested everything . He said , ' There 's nothing wrong with you . We 're gon na get your heavy metals in . " They came back , there was six-times what the average person has . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) So , it 's just fatigue ? Other thing - at one point , you were talking about not being able to remember the lines . What other things ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# So , at the beginning , that 's what it was and it progressed to the point where that final Sunday , I had problems spatially . I was losing my balance and my memory . The lights were too bright . I could n't get enough oxygen . I ended up kind of passing out in my place when I got home . I ended up in the hospital for three days . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Okay . @!**29;940;TOOLONG @(Off-camera) And that 's where I ended up . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) For the facts here . @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Okay . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) How much fish were you eating ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is the only protein I got for 20 years was from fish . I kind of thought I was doing the right thing . And as a result .. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Is this sushi ? Is this raw fish ? I mean ... @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# You know , this is , unfortunately , it was any kind of fish . I thought I was being healthy . You know , because I figured , you know , out of all the meats , fish would be the best . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And these unregulated Chinese supplements ? Were you doing a lot of these ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# No , no , not a lot of Chinese herbs . I 'm just , I 'm a very clean person . I kind of grew up macropsychotic , macrobiotic , I call it , macropsychotic , so I do n't really do Western medicine in terms of I have n't had much aspirin in my life . So when I would get a cold , I would take a few Chinese herbs . I do n't think that 's a variable . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out there . They are a multitude . As you know , some doctors have been weighing in . And we called a legion of them . And they had mixed opinions about it . But so many of them said this is really rare . This is really rare . And that you can have high levels of mercury and not get mercury poisoning . In fact you have to go pretty high . Let me just give you one . @GRAPHICS @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) It 's Dr. Suchard of the University of California in Irvine . And he basically said , it 's easy to have mercury levels five to six times the upper limit by eating lots of fish . It does not result in any objective evidence of mercury poisoning . People who get objectively ill from mercury have levels that are often hundreds or thousands of times the upper limit of normal , that this would be extraordinarily rare . @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# You have to understand something . First of all , I 'm not a doctor . I do n't even play one on TV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a grain of salt . At the same time , I 've never heard of thousands of times . The reality is if your , the level of , I think 200 is when you 've ingested pure mercury . So , those levels , I do n't even really have a reference for . My levels were so high that the doctor had to go to Quest Diagnostics to test it three times in a row . Came back and said , ' We do n't have a reference for this . " @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) But you know ... @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# So , I can only speak in terms of how this was playing on me . Do you know what I mean ? @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Let me talk about the other rap out there because we keep reading it in gossip columns among other things , that the rap on you is that you were out at clubs at night . That you were bored with the show , partying , all this ... @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Let 's be really clear . David Mamet is one the greatest American playwrights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was living my dream . We had brilliant reviews . We were sold out every night . This was the greatest time of my life , Diane . I would have loved to go out . I could n't do it . My body was fighting this mercury toxicity to the point where if I had a glass of red wine , it was too much . I think it makes for a great story , to be honest with you . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Yeah . But what about your fellow castmates there ... @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Uh-huh . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) ... and David Mamet saying that you 're leaving to become a thermometer ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Yes . He 's a brilliant playwright , and that 's a great line . You know , it really is . It 's a very funny line . I could n't make it through the show . The third day in the hospital , Dr. Robert Stark , who 's a cardiologist of 27 years at Yale , said ' You have a resting heart rate of 47 . Your body is desperately trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Jeremy , is enforced rest . You do n't wan na have a heart attack . " And when a cardiologist says this to you , - you do n't quite know what to do . You 're sitting in a hospital bed . You can either go against doctor 's orders or you can listen to the three different doctors that were in the hospital with me. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) What about the producers who have said you cost the show its profitability , those were the days it was gon na go into profit and some , there 's an implication they might be looking at investigating you . @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# The last thing I ever thought about doing was not completing this run . I 've never not completed anything in my life . I 'm very proud to say that I 've been a workhorse my entire life . My intention was to finish this thing . The brilliant Bill Macy has just taken over . He 's been doing Mamet for about 30 years . He is a genius . And he 'll be incredible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to continue forever . And they pulled me out of this thing . And that 's the truth , Diane . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) So , what are you doing now ? No more fish ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# I have n't had ... @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Is the mercury gone ? @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# I have n't had a piece of fish in five months . I mean , as soon as I heard this , I stopped all fish whatsoever . You do a process , and I do n't wan na bore you with all of this , but called kilating and you get everything out of your body . You extract all ... @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) That 's controversial , though , the kilating , but yes , you know . @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Well , and it 's also - can really what weigh on your system . But you have to get it all out of your system completely . And that 's the thing . I come from a theater family . My father , after doing ' King Lear " and being very , very sick , passed away . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you talk about the show must go on , this is in my DNA , as you know . You know the history with my family . So , to have the rap on me be that I walked out on this thing , this was my finest moment . This is what I 've been working for my whole life . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) But how do you feel about all this , when you look up and it 's ' Saturday Night Live " and everybody 's making jokes with all and ... @!JEREMY-PIVEN-@1THR# Well , the reality is there 's been this void where I have n't spoken and said a thing . And I think I wanted to come out here and say the truth , which is I was brought to my knees . From the second week of rehearsal , I was propped up by this great doctor . And I did n't think that I 'd be even able to make it through previews . And I did . And I was proud of that . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And the aftermath a little embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have n't been able to tell my story .

Why not let her crash the line ? @!SHOPPER-@1MALE@2-# I think my life is a lot shorter than hers . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Well , maybe not , if she keeps cutting lines . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Ma'am , I 'm sorry , do you mind if I get ahead of you . @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# Go right ahead . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Thank you . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) The woman steps away for a moment , and that 's when the expectant mom waves her husband ahead . @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# Oh , with all this ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You already said I could go ahead . @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# No , no , not like that . @!**29;2375;TOOLONG No , this is the express . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Yeah , but she told me I could go ahead . @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# No . She has these two things . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Well , she already said I could go ... @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# I did not . She had two things . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I asked her if I could go ahead of her and she said okay . @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# Not with all this . No way . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# We had a deal , I thought . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# You know what ? Karma. @!SHOPPER-@1FEMALE@2# You know what , karma , I do plenty of them .

Karma will come back to bite you . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Meanwhile , our expectant dad is getting people pretty riled up counting the bottles in another shopper 's case of soft drinks . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Okay ?

Are you insane ? @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Shopper Kathleen Fleming @(PH) says breaking life 's little rules can sometimes have big consequences . @!KATHLEEN-FLEMING-@# Once you take a rule that you follow to be polite or - courteous and you get rid of that one time , then the next time , it becomes easier . And before you know it , people are doing things that are seriously wrong . You have to respect those around you or everything just crumbles . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent out of shape when all they stand to lose is a little time , what will happen when letting someone cut the line starts costing people money ? Big money . @!LESLIE-@1SHOPPER@2# Oh , you 've got to split with that me. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Hell no , lady . It 's my lucky day . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) When " What Would You Do ?

Happy I did n't win anything . @!LINDA-@1SHOPPER@2-# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) So , all 's well that ends well .

I let him cut me in line . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) And remember John Conners , the man who angrily dropped his items on the counter and walked out ? Well , he left happy , too .

But then , you see the guy doing something secretly , something frightening . What would you do ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Have a seat . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Right here ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Sure . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) A couple on their first date at McLoone 's Pier House on the Jersey shore . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I do n't know if I dressed up enough . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# No . You look great . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I mean , it was a first date . I wanted to be a little , you know , casual . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Sure . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) She has no idea she 's in real danger . Watch what happens when the young lady leaves . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Excuse me. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) That 's right . He just drugged her drink . We wanted to find out what people would do if you saw a guy do this . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Well , here 's to you . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Here 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to him , or just walk away ? It sure looks like this first couple sees everything . You can tell by the concern on her face . But will she say anything ? Not yet . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Hey , salud. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Salud. @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) In fact , they look away as she takes a drink . It 's a good thing this couple are actors and the powder stirred into her drink is just sugar , not a dangerous date rape drug that can even be fatal . But they do n't know that . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'll be right back . I just got to use the restroom. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Okay . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Our actor excuses himself , but this couple says nothing . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Excuse me .

And then , she gives her some motherly advice . @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# I always tell my kids , ' If you leave your drink , just get another one when you come back . " @!WALTER-@1CUSTOMER@# Yes . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Thank you . @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# You 're welcome . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But why did n't they just tell her that her drink was spiked ? @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# I did n't know what relationship they had . But once I found out that it was a first date , I definitely would have said something . @!WALTER-@1CUSTOMER@# See more like @(inaudible) . @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# I do n't think I would have let them walk out together , let 's put it that way . @!WALTER-@1CUSTOMER@# Yeah . I would have been ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it myself . @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) There are many reasons why people hesitate to get involved , according to Colgate psychology professor , Carrie Keating . @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# The harm in saying something is really quite small when you stop to think about it . But we 're so sensitive to embarrassment , to stepping out of line , to one another 's privacy , that sometimes we do n't step up when real action is called for . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Well , we 're about to get that real action more than we ever expected . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# These seats taken , bro ? @!WAITER-@1MALE@2-# No , man . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Pinot would be perfect . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Okay . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I 'll take a Pinot. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Okay . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Can you watch my drink ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah .

Shut up . Shut up . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'm gon na hit the restroom .

I sure hope they do something . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I think they thought that I was kind of asking for it in a way . @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) It 's a beautiful day for a stroll at the beach .

I wan na use the restroom. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Sure . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But when she gets up to go to the bathroom , her date slips something into her drink . Yesterday , when she was dressed conservatively , people wanted to help . @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# Excuse me , this really is n't good . @!WAITER-@1MALE@2-# What 's wrong ? @!ANGIE-@1CUSTOMER@2# Could you give her another drink ? @!DOUG-@1CUSTOMER@2-# Throw that wine away . She said it tastes funny . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) This time , Brigitte is back with a different look . Will it matter ? @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# She looks like she 's been there , done that . And I would imagine maybe not as much sympathy for her . When we see the facial cues and the body appearance of people who look more innocent , we 're much more likely to give them help . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 've got my hands full there , huh ? @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) These guys check out his date and then they do some male bonding . We ca n't show you their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I wish I could do that ( censored by network ) . Unfortunately , I got married a long time ago . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah ? Sorry to hear it , man . @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# We might wan na hang out with this guy . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'll teach you all my tricks . @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# Hey , hey . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But what about his biggest trick of all , as he spikes her drink , not once , but five times . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I did n't know I 'd have wingmen . That 's great . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Now , our actress is back . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Hi . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I thought you left . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Oh , no . I got into a conversation in the bathroom . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Oh . Here 's to you . These are nice guys . They 'll take care of you . I 'm gon na go use the restroom . They 'll watch out for you . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Excuse me . Can I get a glass of water , please ? @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Even though she pretends to feel sick , they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do . I sure hope they do something . @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# All right . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# It 's hot in here , huh ? @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Excuse me . Do you have , like , any Tylenol or Advil ? @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) The bartender is in on it , too . @!BARTENDER-@1MALE@2# Tylenol . You got a headache ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Yeah . I got , I just came down with this really bad headache . @!BARTENDER-@1MALE@2# Fine . I will be back for it . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Brigitte might as well be talking to the wall . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Are you all right ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I do n't know . I just do n't feel good all of a sudden . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# What 's the matter ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I feel like shaking . I do n't feel so good . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I have a pool at my house , if you wan na go back there . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Thank you . @!**29;1915;TOOLONG You know , we 'll get our check , too . I 'm gon na , she 's not , she 's not feeling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk away without blowing the whistle ? Well , we later learned that only one actually saw our actor spike the drink , and he does speak up , but not to the victim , it 's to someone else at the other end of the bar . @!CUSTOMER-@1MALE@2-# He turned around , he goes , ' He 's , he 's cheated . " I said , ' Oh , you know him ? He 's married ? " He said , ' No , he 's cheating . Let 's just leave it at that . " So , cheating , meaning , he 's going , he 's gon na get the woman the way he wants . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But when we try to talk to them , they walk away . They would have let our actor take his victim home . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) They acted almost as if she deserved it . @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# Almost . Sometimes we do n't intervene when it 's easy to escape , and the escape here was pretty easy , and he took off . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) If this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in real trouble . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I feel dirty and , like , not like I felt before when I was the cute , little girl . I felt protected and that strangers were really nice . And today , I feel a little violated , in a way , that they did n't come to my rescue or say anything . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Throughout the experiment , most people do react . This man complains to the bartender. @!TIM-@1CUSTOMER@2-# Sir , I think he put something in that drink . @!BARTENDER-@1MALE@2# Who ? @!TIM-@1CUSTOMER@2-# The guy that walked by . We do n't wan na get involved . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) They do n't wan na get involved , but obviously , they 're very concerned and they do their best to help . @!ARTHUR-@1CUSTOMER@# You okay ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I do n't feel so good . @!ARTHUR-@1CUSTOMER@# You okay ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I do n't know . I just got hot all of a sudden , like ... @!TIM-@1CUSTOMER@2-# She said she feels dizzy . @!ARTHUR-@1CUSTOMER@# Really ? @!TIM-@1CUSTOMER@2-# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) They 're speaking out , but once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just saw . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) What went through your mind ? @!TIM-@1CUSTOMER@2-# I wanted to go after the guy , but my buddy , Arthur , would n't let me grab him . Because he knows how I am . I 'm getting ready to hit the guy or grab the guy . @!ARTHUR-@1CUSTOMER@# You got to be careful how you get involved . I wanted to prevent violence and I wanted him to calm down . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) While everyone who 's concerned tells our actress not to drink from her glass , no one tells her what they saw , him spiking her drink . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I heard you 're on a date . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . I 'm really nervous . She 's so pretty . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Do n't be nervous . Just be yourself . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But just when we think no one will actually tell Brigitte the reason for their concern , this couple shows up . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Did you just put something in her drink ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# What ? @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Did you just put something in that drink ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir it . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# No , I was - I was tasting . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) This time , there 's no mincing words . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I saw you put in it and stir it . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Caught red-handed , he denies he 's done anything . But here comes Brigitte . Will she tell her ? To make it easier , we ask Jeremy to excuse himself . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Excuse me , I 'm probably totally out of line . He thinks I 'm crazy . I thought I saw him put something in your drink . And I 'm really nervous right now because I asked him and he said he definitely did n't do it . I would ask the bartender for another glass of wine . Am I crazy ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# No , because it tasted differently when I ... @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Okay . I 'm just telling you what I just saw . And I saw him do it . And I called him on it , and he said no , he did n't , he was just tasting it , and he did n't taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know who he is . I 'm , I 'm just out to dinner with my husband . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# This is my first date with him . Thank you so much . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# You 're welcome . Just watch your back . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Absolutely . Thank you . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# You okay ? @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) But watch what happens now that Jeremy is back . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Did you say something to her ? @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# No. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Oh . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# You want me to check on her ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Does she , well , no , she - she also asked me if I put something in her drink . I mean ... @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Really ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah . And then , she said ... @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# You want me to check on her ? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah , if you want to . I do n't know . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I have to go to the bathroom . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I mean , I , did you say anything to her ? @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# No , I didn't. @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) She 's so concerned that she leaves to check on Brigitte in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to leave with Brigitte . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'll take you over to my place since your place is so far away , and we 'll , what ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# You know , I think maybe you should just go . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I should just go ? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Yep . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Excuse me . She 's paying for her own drink . You heard me. @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Jeremy acts incensed . @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# You got a lot of nerve . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) And Brigitte 's new guardian angel is horrified . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I swear to God I saw it . I 'm not drunk . I have one glass of wine , that was it . @!BARTENDER-@1MALE@2# I believe you . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I called him on and he said he was tasting her drink . He never tasted her drink . He mixed something in it with a straw . @!BARTENDER-@1MALE@2# You know what , you 're a good person for saying it . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I 'm a good person . But he 's nasty and he was just really fresh . What a sleaze . I should 've had him arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our experiment . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I knew it . I knew something weird was going on here . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) You 've been part of ' What Would You Do ? " @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# ' What Would You Do ? " I did it . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) Linda , why were you so determined to help her ? You do n't know her from Adam . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I saw what he did , like , you know , like , you make me cry . I saw him do it . And I would , I would want somebody do that for me. @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) It tears you up . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# Yeah . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) Why ? @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# I do n't know , it 's the right thing to do . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Voiceover) Everyone is touched . Brigitte , you 're , you 're in tears . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# She was just so wonderful . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) You 're an actress . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Yeah . @!LINDA-@1CUSTOMER@2# She 's very good . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Thanks . @!JOHN-QUIONES-@1-# @(Off-camera) This was n't real . @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliving a personal nightmare .

##4030957 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And I am here for " The Roundtable " with George Will as always , Tom Friedman of " The New York Times , " former Speaker Newt Gingrich and Peggy Noonan of the " Wall Street Journal . " And George , let 's begin with this idea of a grand bargain . Tax reform . Health care reform . Social Security reform . We 've even seen presidents try one or two of those . He 's trying to get all three of done . And as he said , everybody 's got skin in the game . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) If everyone has skin in the game , everyone has a grievance with each part of your brand bargain . That may be the problem . His theory , and it may be worth trying , is perhaps that what did in health care reform in the early ' 90s was that everyone could focus all their energies on picking it apart , and that if you have fights going everywhere , somehow , you 'll exhaust the enemy . I 'm now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I think that one thing at a time is at most what you can do in Washington . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But , Newt , he really has no choice , does he , because the way that all the tax cuts expire next year , the only way he can pay for them is he gets some kind of tax reform . And with the deficit where it is right now , entitlement reform , there 's no option but to try it ? @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# You know , we just had a grand bailout . And the grand bailout is a fiasco . The president-elect himself just told you that they do n't even have any idea ; they 're not tracking where the money went . Well , let 's say you 're a small business or you 're self-employed or you 're an entrepreneurial startup . You 're not getting money from the federal government . You 're not getting bailed out . You 're not getting $50 billion or $30 billion ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He says he 's going to change that . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wands up here , politics in America , ultimately , and this is one of our strengths , is about individual human beings and their assessment of what it does to them . Hillary care collapsed the morning the average American looked up and said , that 's a risk to my health care . And I do n't want to risk my health care on some politician 's theory . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know , you bring up an interesting point . Let me bring this to you though , Tom Friedman . We did get a lot of questions about the economy for the president-elect and many of them were saying , I 'm losing my health care , what are you going to do about that ? @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# Well , George , I think one of the things that 's been lost in this discussion is the fact of where this crisis started . It started in the banks . Banks are the heart of our financial system . They pump blood to the industrial muscles , small businesses , big businesses . To me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basically happened is the banks have gone from I 'll give a loan to anyone who can fog up a knife to you are now bankrupt until proven solvent . We 've gone from one extreme to the other . The banking system still is not working . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It 's locked up . @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# And until that is resolved , until you take these toxic assets off the bank balance sheets , close the banks that are insolvent , merge the banks that are weak , and strengthen the ones that are strong so they can do what they must do which is to lend money to American entrepreneurs , you can stimulate until the cows come home and nothing is going to happen . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But that 's why , Peggy Noonan , the president-elect and his team they 're saying first things first . We have to get the stimulus package out there . We have to get the money still flowing to the banks , because unless there 's confidence out there , we 're not going to pull out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sending a great big cloud out there . You know , just a big , huge rolling plan , that they mean to go forward , almost of its own dynamism and pushed in part by a sense of emergency and crisis . My sense watching the president-elect today is that he just may get a lot of the things he wants . So he better be wanting the right things because it is going to be on him in a very big way . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And despite the pushback on Capitol Hill this week , George , it does seem like the broad outlines of his plan are something the Democrats and Republicans can sign on to ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) He 's been very shrewd in matters small and large . Small matter - I do n't know how much subtlety to attribute to the man . But to go and give his speech at George Mason University ... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1 " WA# Yeah . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ... which is famous for its economics department . And its economics department is justly famous for its market orientation . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult for conservatives to say no . Because conservatives , many of them , their object being to constrain the government , subscribe to Milton Friedman 's theory that any tax cut at anytime , of any shape or size or purpose , should be supported to bleed leviathan. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Do you agree with that ? @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# Oh , I think it was tremendously smart thing and must have totally confused his left to suddenly look up and see ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well they 're not all that happy . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# To look up and see $300 billion in tax cuts . And as I think Senator McConnell said , you know , you have to take seriously that part of his program . On the other hand , the question you asked which was the perfect symbol about the organized crime museum in Las Vegas ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The Mob Museum . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# ... which strikes me the mob has enough money if they really want a museum , they can collect the funds . I mean , I do n't think that the mob needs to - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between grand bargains and reality is that all of a sudden , you look at the fine print and you begin to find that asking politicians to pass a stimulus package without politics and asking mayors to be for a stimulus package that does n't take care of the dumbest things they want to do may be beyond human capability . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Tom that may be even more true in the Middle East . And the president-elect stuck by his determination not to say all that much until he 's president . But clearly he said he was going to reinvigorate the peace process once he is . And I guess the question I have for you is , is that really what he wants ? Would he have preferred to kind of push this to Secretary of State Clinton for several months or a year , and is this crisis forcing him to deal with it on day one ? @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# It is forcing him to deal with it on day one . I 'm sure that 's the last thing he wants . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success are de minimus . I was really struck this morning , George , you know , reading the Middle East papers before I came over . And there 's one headline that tells the whole story . Israel and Hamas both reject a cease-fire . These people understand what they 're doing . They each want to destroy the other . Okay ? And this has been going on for a long time . And the sense that kind of , well , you know , well , Clinton left us with a plan , you know , for Middle East peace . Bush did n't do anything for eight years , now let 's get back to the Clinton plan . I think it is really misleading . The fact is the Arab-Israeli conflict , I 've followed it almost my whole adult life , is more broken than at anytime I have seen it since the very beginning . And as a result , the kind of initiative an Obama administration is going to have to pursue when it comes in is wholly different . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Bank very quickly . You have a total lack of confidence I think at the prospects of any self-sustaining , self-government Palestinian state being allowed by Israel on either of its borders now that these people have homemade rockets that could close Israel 's International Airport on any given day is zero . Therefore , it seems to me not only do we need different diplomacy , but without , I would argue , a NATO trusteeship over Gaza and the West Bank , someone literally holding the Palestinians hands there , the idea that Israel is going to evacuate those areas , leave them alone to a self-governing , self-administering Palestinian authority , I just do n't see that happening . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But you ca n't get that until there 's an agreement , Peggy . @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# I think it 'll be part of an agreement . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Part of an agreement . Yeah , that 's the ... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1 " WA# Diplomacy seems to be an open area here . It seems to me , this is where Obama can come forward and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Start it over a little bit , even though it 's been going on all of our lifetimes . There is a sense that diplomatically , things have broken down , and once again , Obama is buying into a very low market . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , George , what he did say is he does want the new approach with Iran . And I wonder if , you know , we used to hear at the beginning of the Iraq War that the road to Jerusalem runs through Baghdad . Does it now run through Tehran ? And does the - some kind of an accommodation with Tehran to have to precede any hope for a deal on the Middle East ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I hope not . Because I think accommodation with Iran is not likely . But beyond that I do n't think it would make a particle of difference to the safety of Israel . The problem is n't that Israel is being provocative . The problem is that Israel 's being is provocative to a bunch of armed people who want it to go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 40-year self-delusion which was perpetuated today . Hamas is pretty straight . I mean it 's not a question about respect or not respect . Hamas has a clear position , destroy Israel . The Iranians in the last few weeks have almost certainly subsidized Syria in getting some 17 terrorists into Bahrain where they were arrested before they could disrupt the pro-American government . An Iranian leader in the last three days has called for killing , in effect , in symbolic language , killing both Mubarak and Abdullah , the leaders of Egypt and Jordan . The Iranians are quite sincere in what they say . They 're quite clear in what they say . They 've been saying it now since 1979 . They want to drive us out of the Middle East , eliminate Israel and create essentially a Shia-dominated system with Iran at its center . Hamas has a narrower view . They just want to eliminate Israel . They do n't care much about the other things . And so you say , let 's have a conversation . And they say terrific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay , now that we 're having a conversation , let 's have respect for each other . They say , terrific , we 'd like to destroy Israel . And the Israelis , frankly , are being feckless in their response . Going in there temporarily for a short period of time - the Israelis indicate clearly , this area has forfeited the right to any form of self-government for the near future . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well they 're indicating now that this could go on for some time though . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# No , but they need to be - there 's a difference between - we did n't say to the Nazis , gosh , we 're a little irritated by the Third Reich , and we think we should negotiate for a while . We basically said , we 're going to eliminate your exist . Hamas as a system starts every morning with a simple predicate . We exist for the purpose of destroying Israel . Now , at some point you 've got to decide , and this goes back to what Tom wrote about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . These people intend to kill each other , and what we do is we drag it out by intervening long enough to have a cease-fire so they can rearm so they can kill each other with more sophisticated weapons in the next round . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So , Tom , what I 'm hearing around the table is a council of despair . @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# It 's a pretty despairing moment . And I think that the only way we 're going to break out of it is - I mean , to Newt 's point , you know , this is a war . Both sides are really in it to the death right now , I mean , Hamas and Israel . But I do n't want to see Israel , you know , spend the rest of its days occupying Gaza and the occupying the West Bank . That is not good for Israel . It is not good for it . It 's not good for Palestinians . But I 'm saying that if we 're going to avoid that , George , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically different kind of solutions . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George , on another matter , I think the president-elect probably disappointed some of his supporters today with his answers on what to do about Guantanamo . It 's not going to happen right away . It 's not going to close down right away . Not necessarily going to change the CIA interrogation program . And decidedly reluctant to talk about investigating the Bush administration . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , with regard to investigating the Bush administration , he 's made the decision that Gerald Ford made with regard to pardoning Richard Nixon which is your presidency can be swallowed up by the past arguments or you can go forward . That 's very sensible . With regard to Guantanamo , the secretary of defense , who is staying on , wants it closed . George W Bush wants it closed . It would be closed already if that were easy . The problem is , there are people there and we have to find someone who will take them either abroad or here in America , where a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the intractable problem . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# I just want to raise one issue that did not come up today that I think is going to become very big this year . There is a war under way in Mexico . More people were killed in Mexico in 2008 than were killed in Iraq . It is grossly under-covered by the American media . It is on our border . It has the potential to extend into our countryside . It 's a very serious problem . And we have managed to neglect it to a point - and we 're fueling it because it 's paid for by our drug money . I mean the illegal narcotics teams in Mexico are in a direct civil war with the government in which they are killing the police , killing judges , killing the army . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So this is a crisis he 's not planning for , but is going to have to deal with ? @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1FO# It 's a crisis nobody in the America system is looking at very much . And it 's a very severe problem . @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point which is that there are many terrible handoffs the Bush administration , many , many , are leaving for President Obama . But there is one overriding large one . There has been no terrorist act in this country since 9/11 . And I think that is a very sobering , weighty handoff for this administration . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He said his number one priority is to keep the country safe . @!TOM-FRIEDMAN-@1 " NE# Absolutely . Because , and I think that 's where the debate 's gon na have to be , where I think the administration , the last one , really faulted itself was not consulting Congress . But the fact is that , you know , the American people do n't want to lose that . And I think that how Obama handles that , I think it 's going to be one of the toughest , toughest challenges going forward . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Peggy , you have helped presidents write inaugural addresses . It seems like the president-elect might be getting a little psyched out by Lincoln ? @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1 " WA# Yeah . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to write a play , I think I 'll sit down and read " King Leer " by Shakespeare . That will make me feel better . So I know he 's freaking himself out . What he really should do is go back and look at the inaugural addresses of all of our past presidents and realize , oh , my goodness , most of them collapse of the weight of the event and the need for poetry . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He seemed to say that . Yeah . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1 " WA# They 're not as a rule so good . Be inspired by the bad ones . But I was very interested in the way he was looking at it . He wants to capture and define a moment . He wants to do it quickly , briefly . As government has grown in the 20th Century , inaugural addresses have gotten longer and more boring . It looks to me like he 's going to try to say something clean , direct , short . That would be nice . And something that obviously he 's working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with Mr Fedrow. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 's right . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well one , I suppose everyone reaches for a memorable line .

Wait till you see it and then you 'll see why . But everyone has their person . @!GIFFORD : Right . @!KOTB : And like I identified -- there was one kind of psycho girl and I know exactly who she is in my friend group , which I wo n't say out loud , but that 's -- like you 're like , oh , my God , that 's so and so . ' @!GIFFORD : We have a psycho girl in our ... @!KOTB : She plays psycho , yes . @!GIFFORD : Who is talking over there ? No , it 's the show . Thank you very much . @!KOTB : What ?

She 's , you know ... @!KOTB : I like that . @!GIFFORD : ... so it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real " Hedda Gabler " as Ibsen had anticipated . @!KOTB : It 's going to be interesting . @!GIFFORD : Mary-Louise Parker . So we 'll go see that . @!KOTB : But this week we 're going to take a little break , so in case you 're wondering what 's happening with us and Broadway , we 'll take a break and next week we 're going to go . @!GIFFORD : Today , I think we 're going to go see " The Reader . " @!KOTB : Are we going ? @!GIFFORD : Now that the weather 's cleared up , OK ? @!KOTB : OK. @!GIFFORD : So we 're trying to see all the movies before the Oscars . @!KOTB : Yes . @!GIFFORD : I think that 's the least we can do . @!KOTB : Yes , it is the least we can do . @!GIFFORD : All right . Now the least we can do is try to make some sense out of this latest -- we love to bring you these polls . @!KOTB : Yes . @!GIFFORD : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and talk to the people that they interview because this one ... @!KOTB : Is weird . @!GIFFORD : ... really surprised me . You want to tell them about it ? @!KOTB : This is a Women 's Health online survey . And it talked about the sexiest body part , a women 's sexiest body part according to 900 guys they surveyed .

Are you kidding ? @!KOTB : I 'm sensitive there . I think that 's weird . OK , 20 -- the next one is the arch of the back , OK , and then the back of the neck . That 's what you said , Jim . And then the arch of the foot , the ear lobes and the back of the knees . @!GIFFORD : Who are these men ? @!KOTB : Who are they ? @!GIFFORD : I mean , who are these ? Does any man in here agrees with that ? Not one guy . @!KOTB : No ? Offscreen Voice : No. @!GIFFORD : What ... @!KOTB : No ? @!GIFFORD : Joe ? @!KOTB : Kevin ? No . Kevin says no. @!GIFFORD : Not ... @!KOTB : Back of the -- no. @!GIFFORD : Not one person said breasts on there . @!KOTB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smile ? @!KOTB : Who said that ? Trying to get brownie points . Oh , come on . That 's ridiculous . OK. @!GIFFORD : How about her brain ? Yeah , we love her . @!KOTB : Yes . Love her brain . @!GIFFORD : I was stunned by that one . @!KOTB : I was surprised . They also came out -- I do n't know if we believe this , but they came out -- there are some creams that are out there that claim to remove fat cells . OK , this one 's called the Radial Tummy Tuck . They ... @!GIFFORD : So ... @!KOTB : They claim if you rub it on your tummy ... @!GIFFORD : After you catch that virus we talked about yesterday . @!KOTB : Right . @!GIFFORD : This is $150 , though .

It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what it says . @!GIFFORD : You take that one and I 'll take this . @!KOTB : It ca n't work , can it ? @!GIFFORD : There 's no research on this one . If you were asked what you think is the sexiest body part on a man ... @!KOTB : Yes ? @!GIFFORD : ... what would you say ? @!KOTB : I would say abs. @!GIFFORD : Yeah , but you do n't see that at first . @!KOTB : Oh , the part you see -- probably jawline . I think that 's ... @!GIFFORD : Really ? @!KOTB : Is n't it ? Yeah , what 's yours ?

Anyway ... @!KOTB : OK. @!GIFFORD : ... you know who can tell who 's going to win the Super Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except manatees and turtles . @!KOTB : Yeah . @!GIFFORD : Manatees and turtles are having contest to see who 's going to win the Super Bowl . @!KOTB : Yes . Right . They put in the two emblems . They had a manatee and a turtle and they went -- they sent them swimming to whatever logo should win , and smartly , both of them chose the Steelers. @!GIFFORD : Now , why do you say smartly ? @!KOTB : Because they 're going to win that thing . @!GIFFORD : How do you know ? Do you follow football all ... @!KOTB : I just -- can I tell you something ? @!GIFFORD : Your brother . @!KOTB : We 're a huge -- my brother 's a huge , huge , huge Steelers fan , in fact he 's going with his friend Malcolm down to watch the game in Tampa . And he 's one of those guys like a lot of men , when their teams loses they go into a deep and funky depression . @!GIFFORD : Oh , yeah . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!KOTB : No , you got -- they have to win . @!GIFFORD : Somebody -- I think it might have been Cindy Adams column this morning in the New York Post . I think it was Cindy . If not , I apologize . But there 's a little joke going around . She said what do you call 20 guys sitting around watching the Super Bowl ? @!KOTB : What ? @!GIFFORD : Did you see that ? @!KOTB : Unh-unh. @!GIFFORD : The Giants . Oh ! @!KOTB : Oh ! That 's not nice . @!GIFFORD : But then every other team around the country can say the same thing ... @!KOTB : Yes . @!GIFFORD : ... that did n't make it to the Super Bowl . Personally , I 'm happy for the Cardinals this year because they 've never been there before . It 's very , very exciting . @!KOTB : It is exciting to them . I agree . @!GIFFORD : And see Arizona 's going through a terrible ... @!KOTB : Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD : ... one of the worst-hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the banking problem and all of that . So ... @!KOTB : I think that ... @!GIFFORD : ... I 'm just going to -- you pull -- you pull for the Steelers. @!KOTB : You 're pulling for Arizona ? @!GIFFORD : I 'm going to pull for Arizona . Yes . @!KOTB : What should we -- we should bet something . What should we bet ? @!GIFFORD : We already got into the Super Bowl pool here .

People start calling us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go , What are we going to do ? We have to be at Frank 's house for the Super Bowl . ' @!KOTB : No , you have to . @!GIFFORD : Yeah . @!KOTB : Is it fun ? Does he get -- he does n't miss a second of the game , is he like that ? @!GIFFORD : No . He 's not like that . You know , one of -- come late , I 'll tell you why . @!KOTB : OK , why ? @!GIFFORD : Because he makes everybody watch me sing the National Anthem back in the , yeah , the 19 -- the -- back in the 1800s. @!KOTB : You roll a tape ? That 's love , baby . @!GIFFORD : He plays the tape of me singing the Anthem in 1995 or whenever it was . But it 's embarrassing . @!KOTB : That 's love . @!GIFFORD : No , he does it to embarrass me . It 's not ... @!KOTB : That 's love . It 's not ? @!GIFFORD : Love has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be there early . @!GIFFORD : You know who 's on today ? I 'm very excited . @!KOTB : Who ? @!GIFFORD : Ashford and Simpson . @!KOTB : Yes , Ashford and Simpson . @!GIFFORD : Ashford -- I saw them downstairs and I did n't even ... @!KOTB : " Solid as a Rock . " @!GIFFORD : ... all these years I 've known them , never realized that it 's Valerie that writes the music and Nick -- Nickolas writes the lyrics . @!KOTB : Yes . Listen to this song . This is their ... ( singing ) ... " solid as a ... " qwq @ ( Audioclip-of- " Soli @!KOTB : And they turned this into " Solid As Barack. " @!GIFFORD : Barack .

Go . Solid . @!GIFFORD : No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm every woman . " @!KOTB : Oh , he wrote those ? @!GIFFORD : I need to talk to him about what he was wearing when he wrote those lyrics . I 'm going to talk to him about that . @!KOTB : Are you ... @!GIFFORD : And was Valerie anywhere near when it happened ? @!KOTB : Yes . @!GIFFORD : I was wondering . @!KOTB : Now , something was upsetting to you this morning in the papers . We were seeing some pictures of Jessica Simpson , remember ? @!GIFFORD : Yeah , I ... @!KOTB : And they were pictures -- I mean everyone was talking about how she looked so heavy . I do n't know if we have those pictures . @!GIFFORD : You know what , they 're -- but they 're not -- they 're just -- it 's beyond cruel what they 're saying . It 's beyond cruel . She 's maybe gained a few pounds , and she 's tiny girl . I 've met her . She 's like 5 ' 2 " . @!KOTB : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10-pound weight gain would be more obvious than on a taller , leaner person . @!KOTB : Well , there was a ... @!GIFFORD : Smaller boned. @!KOTB : ... there was a -- something that came . Her sister had something to say that they just handed us , this breaking news . " OK , since when did a woman 's weight become newsworthy ... " @!GIFFORD : Yes . @!KOTB : ... Ashlee says . " A week after the inauguration with such a feeling of hope in the air for our country , I find it completely embarrassing and belittling to all women to read about a woman 's weight or figure . " @!GIFFORD : I totally agree . And I think it 's beyond -- it 's beyond cruel . If she 's up for a part and needs to look like Daisy Duke , then yeah , I can see why a producer might say , You need to lose some weight before we can shoot this thing . ' @!KOTB : Right . @!GIFFORD : But if it 's just because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little weight ... @!KOTB : So what ? @!GIFFORD : Yeah . @!KOTB : I know , I know . @!GIFFORD : Most of the men saying have lost all their hair , let 's be honest . @!KOTB : Yes , and they 're fat , too . @!GIFFORD : Hello . @!KOTB : All right , we ... @!GIFFORD : Not that we 're going to point that out , because it 's cruel and it 's mean . @!KOTB : It is mean . @!GIFFORD : This has just gone beyond . It 's just cruel . @!KOTB : Yeah , their editorial cartoons and stuff , not nice . @!GIFFORD : Yeah . @!KOTB : All right , we have Sara standing by . @!GIFFORD : Hi , Sara Sage . @!KOTB : Facebook Sara . @!GIFFORD : Oh , my gosh , you do look like you 're wearing extensions today .

Pull . @!SARA-HAINES-report : I told you I got rid of those things . @!KOTB : You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HAINES : Thank you . @!KOTB : OK , what do you got going on , Sara ? @!HAINES : Well , Jason Johnson wrote in . I do n't know if you guys heard about Ellen yesterday . @!KOTB : What ? @!GIFFORD : Tell us about it . @!HAINES : " Well I think I 've solved your problem of getting those numbers up for your friends on Facebook .

She 's sending out one . @!KOTB : One ! @!GIFFORD : And if you read the fine print , it says you may be ... @!HAINES : Have a chance . @!KOTB : You might have a chance ... @!GIFFORD : ... have a chance to . @!KOTB : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get an electronic picture of us . We 're not -- we 're ... @!KOTB : Yes , and you can just check your e-mail . @!GIFFORD : ... make no bones about that . @!KOTB : Wo n't that be something ? Anything else , real quick , Sara ? @!GIFFORD : How many do Regis and Kelly have ? @!HAINES : Wait one second .
