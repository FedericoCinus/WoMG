From that humble beginning the National Wildlife Refuge System has grown to 535 refuges -- more than 95 million acres . Of these , 245 are open to big-game hunting . Bowhunters often overlook national wildlife refuges ( NWRs ) , because many of these areas are seen as a place for duck hunters , not deer hunters . However , most refuges offer great whitetail habitat , such as bottomland swamps and upland hardwood forests . Tom White , a former president of the Arkansas Bowhunters Association , is well aware of this big-buck potential . White has been hunting the White River NWR for the past 20 years . Though he has taken some good bucks there , he admits he has yet to tag anything close to the Arkansas record bow typical whitetail , which scored 177 7/8 . Wayne Lindsey shot that deer in the White River NWR in 1998 . To find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at refuges.fws.gov or 800-344-WILD . Here 's a look at places where some of the best bowhunting can be found . ARKANSAS : WHITE RIVER NWR The Scene : This 160,000-acre refuge lies in the floodplain of the White River in Arkansas near its juncture with the Mississippi . Almost 90 miles long and 3 to 10 miles wide , it contains one of the largest bottomland/hardwood forests in the Mississippi River Valley . The Inside Scoop : The refuge is basically one big island of hardwoods surrounded by fields of soybeans , corn and cotton . Set up at the edge of the refuge near the corn and soybeans where deer move back and forth between feeding-and bedding . When to Go : Bowhunting begins October 1 and runs through the end of January . Refuge manager Larry Mallard sees few bowhunters in November and December despite the excellent late-rut hunting . License Info : You 'll need an Arkansas hunting license . There is a one-time $12 recreational user fee . ( 870-282-8200 ; whiteriver.fws.gov ) GEORGIA : PIEDMONT NWR The Scene : The Piedmont NWR consist of 35,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeks , streams and ponds . Piedmont Fire Specialist John Mason claims the refuge does n't have true wetlands . The Inside Scoop : Hunters gain exclusive access on roads open to motor vehicles during the deer seasons . This means you want to park and walk well away from them before setting up your stand . When to Go : A two-week archery whitetail season takes place beginning in the middle of September . License Info : You must have a Georgia hunting license and a free permit ( available at the refuge ) to hunt here . ( 478-986-5441 ; piedmont.fws.gov ) MARYLAND : BLACKWATER NWR The Scene : The Blackwater NWR includes more than 26,000 acres of tidal marsh and freshwater ponds , 10,000 acres of mixed evergreen and deciduous forests and small amounts of cropland . About 6,000 acres of the refuge are open to hunting . The Inside Scoop : Whitetails get little pressure here , as most hunters are more interested in the sika deer . Blackwater biologist Roger Stone says that translates into some great opportunities for whitetail hunters . Bring a climbing stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh edges . When to Go : The sika and whitetail deer seasons run concurrently ; two months of bowhunting are broken up into five short seasons beginning September 21 . License Info : You 'll need a valid Maryland hunting license and a $20 refuge bowhunting permit . Applications for permits must be received by September 20. ( 410-228-2692 , ext. 120 ; blackwater.fws.gov ) MICHIGAN : SENEY NWR The Scene : The Seney NWR in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , locally known as the " Great Manistique Swamp , " contains 95,212 acres of wetland and forest , including 25,150 wilderness acres . Here , bowhunters can hunt in true solitude . The Inside Scoop : Access is mainly by foot from a road that surrounds the refuge , so get in shape before you hunt here . Unlike in the rest of the state , baiting is n't allowed , and though deer densities are low , quality bucks are not uncommon . Most bowhunters concentrate on the upland forests along the edges of the refuge . When to Go : The bow season runs October 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt here is a Michigan hunting license . ( 906-586-9851 ; midwest.fws.gov/seney ) MINNESOTA : SHERBURNE NWR The Scene : More than three quarters of Sherburne 's 30,665 acres are open to bowhunting . The focus of the refuge is on the restoration of oak savanna , wetland and big woods habitats . The Inside Scoop : The old oak savanna is being recreated by refuge managers , but there remains a number of grown-up fields bordered by woodlots . With the brushy fields providing good bedding cover , find a nearby oak stand that 's dropping acorns and set your stand within 30 to 60 yards of the edge . When to Go : The bow season runs from the middle of September through the middle of December . License Info : No permits or special fees are required to hunt Sherburne . All you need is a valid Minnesota hunting license . ( 763-389-3323 ; **25;1877;TOOLONG ) MISSISSIPPI : NOXUBEE NWR The Scene : The Noxubee NWR contains 44,500 acres of bottomland and upland forest habitat , plus 16 small impoundments and a variety of wetland areas with thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get quite soggy during periods of rainfall , making tall rubber boots a must . If you hunt after heavy rains or near the wetland areas , a pair of hip waders can really help you get into unpressured areas . When to Go : The bow season for whitetails opens October 1 and runs through November 14 . License Info : You 'll need a Mississippi hunting license and a $12.50 permit that can be purchased at the refuge . ( 662-323-5548 ; noxubee.fws.gov ) NEW YORK : IROQUOIS NWR The Scene : The 10,818-acre Iroquois NWR lies midway between Buffalo and Rochester . The refuge 's flat terrain includes freshwater marshes and hardwood swamps that border Oak Orchard Creek . Forests , meadows and fields slope up gently from the wetland 's edge , providing ideal terrain for feeding whitetails . The Inside Scoop : Do n't expect to see an abundance of trophy bucks here , although there are some . The overall population , however , is plentiful and the entire refuge is open to hunting to keep whitetails from over-populating and destroying the habitat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 15 to November 21 . License Info : A free hunting permit may be picked up and filled out at five locations around the refuge . A New York hunting license is also required . ( 585-948-5445 ; iroquoisnwr.fws.gov ) SOUTH CAROLINA : SANTEE NWR The Scene : The 15,095-acre Santee NWR stretches for 18 miles along the northern shore of the famed Lake Marion . It includes freshwater marshes , cultivated fields , cypress swamps , hardwoods and upland pines . The Inside Scoop : Bowhunting pressure is light on the refuge . Though ATVs are not allowed , you 'll need a four-wheel drive vehicle to traverse the refuge 's rough dirt roads . When to Go : The short archery-only deer hunt -- October 11 through 16 -- takes place on 4,000 acres of the Cuddo Unit . Bowhunting for deer is also allowed during scheduled primitive weapons hunts in the Pine Island and Cuddo units . License Info : No entrance or use fees are required of sportsmen beyond a valid state hunting license . ( 803-478-2217 ; santee.fws.gov ) TENNESSEE NWR The Scene : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than 65 miles along Kentucky Lake in northwest Tennessee . About 30,000 acres contain bottomland hardwoods , high-quality oak and hickory forests , freshwater marshes and agricultural lands . The rest is the lake . The Inside Scoop : With much of the land bordering the lake , a hunter with a canoe or johnboat can escape other hunters and reach hard-to-access hunt sites . When to Go : The bow season runs from the last Saturday in September through the early part of November . License Info : You can purchase a permit for $12.50 at the refuge or order it online from the refuge 's Web site . You 'll also need a Tennessee hunting license to hunt here . ( 731-642 -- 2091 ; tennesseerefuge.fws.gov ) TAKE THE HIGH GROUND Because of the numerous creeks and sloughs on most refuges , hunters need to adjust their tactics . Use topo maps to find narrow strips of high ground between watery areas . Deer use these high spots as travel corridors , making them idea , places to set a stand . Illustration <p>

" I like to keep a spinnerbait in the twilight zone , ' just deep enough so I can barely see the blades flashing through Polarized sunglasses when I 'm standing up and retrieving the bait . " -- Charlie Ingram , Tennessee bass pro " I put on a trailer , such as a pork rind or split-tail plastic eel , when I need to bulk up my spinnerbait presentation for greater visibility and attraction . " Marty Stone , North Carolina bass pro Unlike plastic worms ; minnowbaits and shad-imitating crank , baits , a spinnerbait hanging on the rack in a tackle shop does n't look like anything a bass would want to eat . But retrieve it through the water , set its blades spinning and its skirt pulsing , and it comes alive . Something about a spinnerbait 's combination of flash and alluring vibrations triggers vicious strikes when nothing else will . Spinnerbaits are the most versatile bass lures and will produce year-round in any type of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or over any type of cover and are known for catching big bass in water ranging in temperature from just above freezing to summertime hot . No bass is safe when a spinnerbait is passing through its neighborhood . As is true of any lure , however , a spinnerbait 's efficiency is limited by where and how it is fished . There 's also the problem of selection . Spinnerbaits come in all sizes and weights and are equipped with blades in many shapes , sizes , and colors . What 's the perfect bait for the water you 're fishing ? Before you grab a spinnerbait out of the tackle box to try for your next lunker , consider some of the following variables so that you make the right selection . ANATOMY OF A SPINNERBAIT 1 . Blades The blades are cupped to catch water and revolve on the end of a swivel or around the shaft via a clevis . Blades add flash and vibration to a spinnerbait. 2 . Frame Spinner blades are positioned on a wire frame above the hook , giving the lure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffness of the wire determines strength and helps govern the lure 's vibration . 3 . Head Molded jigheads come in various weights and shapes . Heavier weights and bullet-shaped heads typically are used on spinnerbaits intended to be fished in deep-water presentations . 4 . Skirt Materials vary . A rubber or synthetic skirt can be changed to add more realism or to make a spinnerbait more conspicuous in murky or dingy water . Both looks can be desirable for drawing reaction strikes . BLADE DESIGNS 1 . Willow leaf The willow is an elongated blade that delivers maximum flash but not as much vibration as other styles . This type is often paired with a smaller Indiana or Colorado blade . Since it 's shaped like a live baitfish , the willow leaf is a good blade choice in clear water . The willow leaf also sheds grass well , making it the best blade choice around submerged weeds . 2 . Indiana A cross between the willow leaf and Colorado , the teardrop-shaped Indiana blade produces both flash and vibration . It 's a good workhorse blade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This rounded , heavily cupped blade creates intense vibrations that attract bass when visibility is low . Use it in murky to muddy water and at night in all water conditions . FINISHES Choosing Blade Colors Spinnerbait blades usually come in three plating colors ( nickel , gold and copper ) plus an endless variety of painted colors . Wisconsin lure artist Dale Sellers ( sellerscustomlures.com ) , who makes custom spinnerbaits for many top bass pros , says , " Most pros who order tandem spinnerbaits from me request a combination of one gold and one nickel blade ; this gives the lure a combination of flash and contrast while maintaining a natural baitfish look . " Requests for copper blades usually come from anglers scheduled to fish tournaments on tannin-stained lakes -- copper and gold stand out better than nickel in this type of water , " continues Sellers . " I also have lots of orders for spinnerbaits with painted blades , especially chartreuse , which is deadly on smallmouths , and pearl white , which shows up better than plated blades in cloudy conditions . Pike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " RETRIEVES TO TRY Helicopter ( Shown at right ) The helicopter is a good retrieve to use in clear , rocky lakes . Using a short-arm spinnerbait with a Colorado blade , cast to the bank or the top of a point , then keep the rod between 10 and 11 o'clock as the lure " helicopters " down on a tight line . When the spinnerbait hits bottom , drop the rod to 9 o'clock while reeling up slack , raise the rod sharply to 10 or 11 o'clock , and then let the lure fall again . Repeat all the way in . Slow roll This is the bread-and-butter shallow-water retrieve . Hold the rod so the tip is pointed between 9 and 10 o'clock , and reel slowly and steadily so the lure runs off bottom and close to cover . SPINNERBAIT TACKLE Great Rod Reel Combos Most experienced bass anglers fish all but the smallest spinner-baits on bait-casting gear . Rod Stiffness " A rod that 's too stiff will cause you to react too quickly when you feel a strike . " says bass pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure out of the bass 's mouth . A rod that 's too limber wo n't have the back-bone needed to pull a really big bass out of heavy cover , which is where spinnerbaits excel . A medium or medium-heavy rod is best . " Ideal Length " In spring , when bass are holding tight to the bank , a five-and-a-half- to six-foot rod lets you make super-accurate casts beneath overhanging trees , " says Bacon . " A pistol grip is perfect for these short sticks . In summer and fall , when bass are on big main-lake structures like points and stump flats , a seven-foot rod is a better choice ; it facilitates longer casts and is useful for steering the lure around cover . When fishing deep water , a long rod moves a lot of line for better hooksets . " Right Reels As for reels , Bacon favors a combination of slow- and high-speed bait-casters to accommodate various styles of fishing in different types of cover and structure . Line Choices Bacon uses abrasion-resistant monofilament that ranges from 14- to 20-pound-test . RETRIEVES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique is effective when bass are suspending over submerged cover or structure in 10 to 20 feet of water . Make a long cast with a heavy spinnerbait ( no lighter than 1 ounce ) , count the lure down to the desired depth , and reel at a medium-slow pace with the rod between 9 and 10 o'clock . Be sure to position the boat far enough from the target so that the spinnerbait travels on a horizontal track as it passes over the structure or cover . Bulging Try this with a long-arm spinnerbait that has a big Colorado blade . As soon as the lure touches down , begin reeling and raise the rod to between 10 and 11 o'clock . Reel fast enough so that the lure rises to just beneath the surface , creating a wake . If the blade breaks water , slow down . SPINMEISTERS Bump Cover " A spinnerbait is designed to deflect off hard objects like laydown logs , stumps and rocks , " says Tennessee bass guide Jim Duckworth . " Most strikes occur the instant the lure careens off cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimics the erratic behavior of a frightened baitfish . Use the rod to steer the lure into cover rather than around it . " Grass Attack Spinnerbaits are n't true weedless lures , but they can be fished effectively in and around thick grass . " In big , grassy expanses , a spinnerbait is a great search lure , " says Kentucky bass pro Kevin Wirth . " For grass , use a spinnerbait with a heavy wire arm ; a hooked bass will often bury in the weeds and a thin wire frame will bend or break when you try to winch out the fish . Willow leaf blades can be slow-rolled through eel grass , bulrushes and Kissimmee grass without weeding up too badly . " Wirth casts the spinnerbait into the cover , lets it drop until he feels it contact the vegetation , then rips the lure into open water with a sharp stroke of the rod : " This can trigger a hellacious reaction strike , " he says . SPINNERBAIT STYLES 1 . Long-arm This is the most popular type for all-around use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailing blade extends past the hook . Usually rigged as a " tandem " ( with two blades ) , the long-arm is the gold standard for horizontal retrieves around shallow wood and grass cover . 2 . Short-arm Here , the wire arm is abbreviated so the blade , often a single Colorado , rotates above the hook . Short-arm spinnerbaits produce hard-thumping vibrations and are favorites for night fishing . They 're often fished with pork frog trailers . 3 . Deep-water These big boys have large blades and a heavy head ( 1 to 21/2 ounces ) and are used by bass anglers in deep natural lakes and impoundments for probing structures such as underwater humps , channel drop-offs and ledges . Jumbo spinnerbaits are also appealing to pike , muskies and stripers. 4 . Bucktail A favorite of smallmouth anglers , bucktail spinnerbaits normally feature a short arm , a single Colorado or indiana blade , and a skirt of synthetic or natural hair , which " breathes " during a stop-and-go retrieve . Bucktails work especially well in cold water and at night . 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long wire arm ; when retrieved in clear to moderately stained water , it convincingly mimics a school of small baitfish. 6 . Wake Maker Known for its catches of lunker bass , this long-arm spinnerbait is equipped with an extra-large Colorado blade . When retrieved just beneath the surface , the heavily cupped blade throws a telltale wake or " bulge " that suggests a fleeing gizzard shad or bluegill . " Wake " it around laydown logs and over submerged grass beds , using a reel with a fairly fast retrieve ratio and a rod at least 6 feet long so the lure can be held closer to the surface better . 7 . Mini-spin This finesse spinnerbait , usually rigged with a single blade , is designed primarily for crappies and panfish . But its diminutive size makes it a good choice for catching finicky bass in tough conditions : in clear water , after a cold front or following a heavy rain that temporarily disrupts the PH balance in a lake or pond . 8 . Jig Spin A soft-plastic grub is substituted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioned on a wire frame above the hook ( Johnson Beetle Spin ) or attached to the hook via a swivel ( Slider Whirley Bee , shown ) . A jig spin is one of the best farm pond lures for bass and panfish and a solid choice for smallmouths in clear , rocky lakes . JUDGING RETRIEVE DEPTH RETRIEVES TO TRY Flutter ( Shown at left ) When bass are holding tight to submerged trees , stumps or patchy weed cover , cast a 3/8-ounce spinnerbait past the cover , slow-roll it across the top and then kill the retrieve just as the lure reaches the edge of the cover . The spinnerbait will flutter straight down on a fairly tight line , triggering a strike . High-speed This is a good retrieve to try when bass are lethargic and need a wake-up call . Cast a 3/8-ounce lure with two small willow or Indiana blades close to cover . Raise the rod to 11 o'clock and reel quickly so the spinnerbait runs a foot or so beneath the surface . In clear , rocky smallmouth lakes , use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles . WHEN TO USE A TRAILER RATING WEIGHTS Choosing the Right Weight According to professional bass fisherman Alton Jones of Texas , " A three-eights to half-ounce lure works great for most shallow-water applications anywhere . I 'll go to a heavier lure , three-quarters to one and a half ounces , when bass are deep , and a lighter lure , one-eighth to one-quarter ounce , when I want the lure to float ' across the top of submerged grass beds .

##2001061 See also additional image(s) in Table of Contents file of same issue . The harsh ring of the satellite phone shattered the silence . Chase Fulcher had been waiting patiently for hours . Elsie answered the call from her husband , nodded a couple of times , and with a shallow " ah-huh " hung up . The wind rushed hard against the shanty ; an occasional moan accented the timbers ' struggle to remain steadfast . She turned to Fulcher . " He 'll be here in short order . Like I figured , weather put ' em down . " Fulcher , a fortysomething Kentucky native , turned up his collar and walked out onto the rickety wooden porch . A bitter nor'easter blew stiff into his face , his collar flapping as he spied the tiny seaplane coming into view on the distant horizon . The little plane made a wide are some 600 yards off the island 's shore , searching for solitude from the wind and a place to land . A few minutes later it chugged up to the floating dock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the lap of his wrinkled trousers . It had been a rough ride . Under his breath he cursed the weather that had grounded him for three hours . Disheveled , with a three-day stubble , he walked over and offered a leathered hand . " Guy Antilla , " he said . " Please call me Guy . " His accent hinted at his Finnish ancestry . Introductions complete , Antilla said , " We 've got to hurry . It 's a long trip and darkness will be on us soon . " Fulcher and his guide , Ben Sternbergh , jammed the small fuselage with a week 's worth of gear , then somehow squeezed in themselves . GOATS BELOW Base camp was about 80 miles due north , through a narrow passage , along a translucent blue glacier and over three snow-capped mountains . Fulcher came to the Yukon to fulfill his bowhunting dream . Sternbergh tugged on his coat and tapped his finger on the plane 's window glass , pointing to the jagged terrain below . " That 's them , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , straining for a look . Two thousand feet below the plane 's belly , three goats perched on a tiny rock cliff out-cropping just below a fresh snow line . Spotting them , Fulcher nodded with a big smile and signaled a thumbs up as Antilla guided the plane down to the mountain 's base . Once they drifted to a stop , Sternbergh and Fulcher moved quickly to unload . Antilla offered both men a firm handshake as a farewell . The small plane disappeared quickly , leaving the two with the sound of rushing water and howling wind . The radio had warned of a front that would push through the area , bringing even stronger winds and heavy thunderstorms . They quickly set up their small camp . The wind was blowing so hard that Fulcher had to put rocks inside the tent to keep it from blowing away . That night Fulcher could n't sleep . He kept replaying the vision of those goats on top of the mountain . As awe-inspiring as the sight was , he could n't help but think about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 4 a.m. and Sternbergh rose as daylight broke . They packed light , taking only the essentials they would need to survive a night on the mountain in case they got stuck . Sternbergh shouldered his pack and his .338 Winchester Magnum -- grizzly insurance . Fulcher grabbed his gear and followed . The air grew thin as the two men climbed , struggling during their four-hour ascent over unforgiving terrain . As he picked his way along a steep ridge , Fulcher chuckled to himself , thinking that here was a place that only a mountain goat would go . Amusement suddenly turned to panic as his footing gave way . Sliding toward the edge of the mountain , Fulcher flailed about for a handhold . As he gathered speed , he rolled onto his stomach , clawing for anything in the loose rock that would cancel his rapid descent . Somehow he managed to grab a small rock that kept him from going over the edge . Battered , bruised and bleeding , Fulcher eventually regained his composure . He now had a much clearer understanding of why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back to their base camp 16 hours after they had left , looking more like a couple of interstate overpass transients than an accomplished bowhunter and a professional guide . They had spotted only one goat . The third day of the hunt was equally fruitless . Sternbergh and Fulcher discussed their options and decided that they had to move to another mountain . Fortunately , Antilla was due for a fly-by that day to check on their camp . They hurried back to meet his plane and switch locations . Their new camp was less hospitable than the first . It was harsh , cold and moonlike . The temperature hovered near zero and the wind gusted at 45 mph . But they had spotted seven large goats on a nearby mountain , so it was home for now . THE LOW GOAT The next morning , Fulcher grabbed the spotting scope and slipped outside for a look at his new mountain . To his surprise , he spotted a billy halfway up . Shaking uncontrollably from the cold , he ducked back into the tent to tell Sternbergh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Their teeth chattering , the hunter and guide exchanged high fives . Their plan was to climb up above the goat , stalk down to it and , hopefully , get within bow range . They dressed quickly , then packed enough for two days on the mountain . They hiked for about three miles , figuring they were at least a mile downwind of the goat . Then they started their climb and for four hours struggled nearly straight up with their 45-pound packs . Eventually , the two crawled to a cliff that overlooked the goat 's bedding area . Sternbergh glassed left and right , scanning the terrain , but saw no goat . They figured their prey had winded them . Sternbergh was certain the goat had climbed higher . Fulcher tightened his backpack straps and started uphill . Two hours later , they found themselves staring straight up a sheer vertical bluff . Sternbergh looked at the imposing rock face rising before him . " The only way we 're getting to the top is to drop back down the mountain and go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would mean another day lost to climbing . " Nope , let 's climb it . " Sternbergh raised an eyebrow . " You can make it up that ? " The guide was 20 years younger than his client . Determined , Fulcher nodded . Two-thirds of the way up , gravity again proved stronger than Fulcher 's desire for a goat . His rocky foothold gave way , and he went on another wild ride down the mountain . Luckily , he slammed into an outcropping of rocks , stopping short of the mountain 's edge . Lying there , still , Fulcher checked himself for injuries . His body , though cut and battered , seemed intact . It was his sanity he questioned . It 's only a damned goat , after all , he thought . They eat license plates and tin cans . Minutes later , Fulcher 's freshly scraped and bloody hands were again pulling him toward the summit . Once at the top , Sternbergh offered Fulcher an arm to help him sit . Fulcher 's body was spent and his spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulcher rested . Unbelievably , just 900 yards away were two trophy billies . With only three hours of daylight left , it was n't clear they could get to the goats fast enough . The hunter and guide made a pact to move as quickly as humanly possible . After two hours they had climbed above the goats . Using a rocky bluff for cover , Sternbergh belly-crawled through the snow for a closer look . Amazingly , both billies were within bow range . One was bedded down ; the other , larger goat was standing , looking down the mountain . Sternbergh signaled Fulcher over . Fulcher peered at the goats through fogged binocular lenses . Squinting for a second , he made the call . Distance : an even 50 yards . Elevation : 45 degrees downhill . He did the math in his head , subtracting 10 yards for the acute downhill angle . That put his goat at 40 . Fulcher guessed the left-to-right crosswind was blowing 35 mph . He then mustered everything the mountains had n't taken out of him to draw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little left of the goat 's front shoulder . A quick prayer followed by a gentle squeeze on his release and the arrow was gone . It disappeared into the goat 's shaggy vanilla coat , the crimson-stained shaft exiting on the aft side , its broadhead sparking on the rocks . The goat ran , stumbled and fell down . Fulcher collapsed right there in the snow . OUT OF TIME Fulcher and Sternbergh had little time to revel in the moment . The temperature was plummeting and they were on top of a mountain with darkness minutes away . Sternbergh checked his watch ; they had left base camp 15 hours ago . The men worked to cape and clean their trophy , finishing the task by the light of a full moon after the batteries in their headlamps died . Now they faced a descent down the mountain in the dark . Five hours later , they stumbled off the mountain onto the glacier . Fulcher checked his watch . It had been 21 straight hours since they had begun their journey up that mountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propeller . Antilla landed his plane , walked over to the hunters and threw out a glib " Any luck ? " Neither Fulcher nor Sternbergh spoke . Fulcher 's mind raced . Luck ? Yes , he was lucky . Lucky to have survived two falls . Damned lucky to be alive , in fact . Lucky to have had a chance at a goat of a lifetime . Fulcher turned to Sternbergh and grinned . There was no need for words . Their mettle had been tested . With the plane packed , they left the mountain , glacier , goats and punishing pain behind . The tiny plane climbed sharply into a bright blue sky . Fulcher found himself contemplating just how warm his bed was back in Kentucky . Illustration <p> 
##2001062 So there you are , headed to the backcountry for a true wilderness hunt . You 've decided to do it the hard way -- without horses , on foot and with a couple pals who , like you , are ready for a challenge . Where do you start and what are your expectations ? The fact is , you 're looking at the toughest hunt of all . You 'll be packing in all your gear on your back and , if you 're successful , you 'll be carrying meat out the same way . Obviously , you 'll need to travel light , pare down your equipment and consider every last ounce . An extra pound might seem harmless when you first don your pack , but it 'll be a serious burden as the trail gets longer and steeper . HOME SWEET HOME A shelter of some sort is required for protection from the weather and insects . Do n't discount the latter . In warm weather , black flies , mosquitoes and other pests can make a trip miserable . A lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be waterproof and able to withstand strong winds . Most tents that are guaranteed to be waterproof need to have the seams sealed . A tube of sealer often comes with the tent . Apply the sealer according to instructions and then test the tent under your yard sprinkler for at least an hour . SWEET DREAMS A sleeping bag should weigh 4 pounds or so . I prefer goose down insulation , but it 's clammy and cold when it gets wet and takes a long time to dry . If there 's any chance of moisture getting into your shelter , use synthetic insulation . Buy a stuff sack that 's tough and waterproof . Most conventional sacks are flimsy . Do n't use a trash bag , since it might rip in the brush . Always use a pad under your bag . I like closed-cell pads because they roll up smaller than the open-cell types . A pad also eliminates the discomfort of rocks or twigs beneath you . THE RIGHT PACK The tent , sleeping bag and pad should be tied tightly to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well constructed is a must . It should have wide shoulder straps and a belly strap to steady it on your upper torso . When fully loaded , it should weight no more than 40 pounds , but that depends on your physical condition and ability to carry a heavy load -- someone in good shape can heft an 80-pound pack . Some packs have all sorts of bells and whistles , with compartments and sleeves that hold gear . I like at least one sleeve to hold a water bottle or two . BACK-COUNTRY CLOTHES Clothing is a matter of choice , but I keep it simple . A wool shirt , a waterproof jacket with a hood that 's zippered on and not attached by snaps , waterproof pants , three extra pairs of socks and underwear , long johns and gloves are basic requirements . Do n't get carried away by bringing too much clothing . Think warm and dry . I take along a wool watch cap to wear in rainy weather . I also wear it when I sleep , since most heat is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weather . Lightweight waterproof boots with sturdy air-bob soles are my preference , but if it 's cold I want my boots to be insulated . FOOD AND WATER Cookware should weight no more than a pound or two . Choose a set that 's made especially for camping and collapses into a compact unit . A collapsible cup is a good idea , as are plastic spoons and forks . Water will make or break your trip .

##2001063 SUCCESSFUL DEER HUNTERS THINK more like chess masters than cooks . Rather than adhere to tried-and-true recipes , they look for any kind of opportunity and adjust to conditions as they change . The ability to approach every hunting situation with the same kind of open mind and without pre-conceived notions about " how it 's supposed to be done " is a trait all of the best deer hunters share . Plus , it 's a lot of fun to pull off-the-wall stunts that actually work in special situations . The improvisational skills of the following hunters have helped them make the most of unusual circumstances . Their examples are an inspiration for every deer hunter who has ever asked himself , " What do I do now ? " ANY TREE THAT 'S HANDY Jim Hill , from Minnesota 's Twin Cities , is one of the best and most creative deer hunters in the country . I 've hunted with him for 10 years and have come to expect the unexpected from him . Hill so enjoys doing things his way that sometimes I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school football team had a tight end who could turn even a routine crossing pattern into an adventure that would end with a diving catch ; the important thing was , he always caught the ball . Hill is like that -- the straight-forward approach is a bit too ho-hum for him . Two whitetails that he took with his bow are good examples of his imaginative approach to hunting . Hill saw one of them for the first time as he left his hunting area after dark . The dandy buck crossed a county road in front of his truck 's headlights . Early the next afternoon Hill was scouting the road 's soft shoulder for fresh tracks when the farmer who owned the adjoining property drove up . Soon the farmer was showing Hill exactly where he had seen other bucks crossing in the past . He also gave Hill permission to hunt his land . The Haystack Maneuver Sometimes being creative means thinking far outside the box ... and into something else . A few seasons ago a bowhunter $$ know , who wants to remain anonymous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most evenings , the buck my buddy was hunting entered a grass field from a huge burned-over cattail swamp that other hunters had completely overlooked . There were no trees on its fringes that were big enough to hold a stand . After he puzzled over the situation for a few days , the light of inspiration began to glow in my friend 's mind . He paid a visit to the farmer who owned the field and obtained his permission to work out a crazy hunch . The next afternoon , the bowhunter reached the field early and tore into a nearby haystack with one of his rattling antlers . Soon he had hollowed out a hole large enough to hide in . The buck showed up on schedule that evening , but he came around the bale from the opposite $$direction and caught my friend flat-footed . The bowhunter regained his composure in time to make a very unconventional 7-yard shot . Another friend of mine , Rod Ponton , was faced with a similar tough stand-entry challenge a few seasons ago . The tree he wanted desperately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank of a narrow creek directly below a bedding ridge . November was very dry that year , and crispy oak leaves covered the forest floor to ankle depth . " It was like walking on corn flakes , " Ponton says . " I knew I could n't sneak to the tree without being heard by every deer on the ridge . So instead , I ran to the stand from the edge of the woods , trying to sound as much like a buck chasing a doe as possible . Less than a minute after I got into the tree , a giant eight-pointer came down off the ridge to investigate and stopped to hit a scrape right under my tree . He worked the overhead branch so hard I had to grab onto a limb to keep from falling out of the narrow crotch stand I had wedged into that small tree . " Everything happened so quickly that Ponton had to rush his shot . He missed the buck . Still , the fact that he was able to fool the buck 's ears to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard other stories of hunters who used terrain features to stay out of sight long enough to run within easy gun range of a buck . Iowa hunter Bruce Hupke opened my mind to the idea several years ago when he told me how he ran to within 40 yards of a buck that was hidden behind a ridge . Deer do n't necessarily associate the sound of something running with danger , as they do the sound of something trying to sneak toward them . Sometimes you can actually get away with more using the bold approach . When there 's no way to sneak closer without being heard , and you 've nothing to lose , it 's worth a try . Don Those Deer Ears The late Roland Hausmann was one of the best whitetail bowhunters in North America in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s . Hausmann lived on the border of Minnesota and South Dakota and specialized in hunting marshes in both states . One of our mutual acquaintances tells of visiting Hausmann 's home in the early ' 70s and seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to his host 's camouflage jacket . When asked about the ears , Hausmann turned a bit sheepish but finally admitted that he wore them when hunting the marshes . Hausmann went on to offer a seminar in marsh hunting . Deer move along the upwind side of any openings in the rushes , he said . From there , they can smell anything in the thick cover and see anything in the open , thereby covering all the bases and making it very difficult to catch them unawares . Hausmann overcame the challenge with a set of big brown ears . He would hunt the opposite side of the openings and crunch around inside the rushes with the deer ears on his head . Bucks that caught a glimpse of the " doe " often came closer for a look . Hausmann dragged some big bucks out of the swamps back then , though such a tactic would be dangerous to try nowadays . At times , deer hunting presents unique problems that ca n't be solved with conventional answers . When such times arrive , the best hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they study the possible outcomes in light of what they know about deer and then they think of what might work . If it 's within the law , it 's within bounds . A large pine tree that had broken off 15 feet above the ground stood just inside the property line from the road ditch and within reasonable bow range of the most likely crossing . After the landowner had driven away , Hill looked around for a tree in which to hang his stand but soon gave up . What the heck , he thought . He climbed to the bare top of the broken tree . " I felt silly , but I did n't have any choice and I wanted to see what would happen , " Hill recalled . " I stuck out like a sore thumb . Every time someone drove by I dropped into the branches so they would n't see me . At least twenty cars passed under my stand that afternoon . My back got so stiff from all the crouching I could barely straighten up . Then , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my side of the road , followed by a big buck . They started heading toward the crossing . When the buck came even with the tree , I shot . He was about twenty-five yards away . " Hill drilled the buck through the heart and was able to recover the massive whitetail quickly . He might have felt ridiculous taking a stand in the broken tree , but the absurdity of it all melted away as he admired the 10-point rack that grossed 160 inches . DO WHAT YOU GOT TA DO Hill 's next strange-but-true lesson in creativity took place during the 2000 season . He first saw the buck he targeted in August as it fed in a bean field . Hill spotted it again in mid-October and a few times in early November . Despite his ability to zero in on the buck 's travel corridors , Hill never quite found himself in the right place at the right time . Then , on a cold morning as he was putting up a tree stand , Hill spotted the buck across the field . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small brushy area on the field 's edge as if an invisible barrier kept him hemmed up there . Hill concluded that the whitetail had a doe stashed nearby and was n't going anywhere until she got up . Recollections of past experiences ran through Hill 's mind . A bowhunter has a tough time during the rut . Patterns go out the window . One morning a hunter sees a buck trailing does through the woods ; he goes back there the next day and the day after that , but never sees the same buck again . Finally the regretful hunter realizes that had he been more aggressive when he first spotted the buck , he might have stood a better chance of getting within range . After many years of deer hunting , Hill understands that premise as well as anyone , and he took such thoughts to heart that cold day . Changing gears , he spent the midday hours crawling in close to the sequestered pair . Using a ditch for cover , Hill got within bow range of the brush line . Then he belly-crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat down in the ditch that drained the field to wait . He did n't even know if the deer were still there ; all he had was hope . Two hours into the watch , Hill 's persistence was rewarded . A small buck showed up to investigate the heady smell of the hot doe . As soon as the young whitetail approached the area where Hill had last seen the monarch , the big buck walked out of the cover to confront the interloper . The two bucks diverted each other , presenting Hill with an easy 30-yard shot . Seconds later the huge buck stumbled and fell , not 60 yards away . The giant 10-pointer grossed 182 inches . Again , the key to Hill 's success was improvisation . Rather than try to figure out what he was supposed to do , he did what he had to do . I RAN TO THE STAND , TRYING TO SOUND AS MUCH LIKE A BUCK CHASING A DOE AS POSSIBLE . A GIANT EIGHT-POINTER CAME DOWN OFF THE RIDGE TO INVESTIGATE AND STOPPED TO HIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Fasten the shelving unit to the wall to prevent it from toppling over . If it 's a wood-framed wall , secure the unit by driving two 2-inch screws through the upper-pegboard support and into the wall studs . For a concrete wall , drill holes with a masonry bit , insert lead anchors into the holes and drive screws through the support and into the anchors . FEW PIECES OF OUTDOOR GEAR ARE more difficult to store than a kayak or a canoe , which is why they 're usually left outside under tarps .

The pulleys hang from screw hooks placed in a one-by-four cleat that 's screwed to ceiling joists . The kayak rests in a separate cradle made from one-by-fours and two-by-threes . Attached to the cradle are two rope slings that hook onto S-hooks connected to the pulleys . This trapeze will support a 50-pound , 9-foot kayak . To support a heavier , longer kayak or canoe , you 'll have to use thicker rope , heaviergauge screw hooks and eyes and larger pulleys. shopping list 1 pine one-by-four , 10 feet 2 pine one-by-fours , 8 feet 1 spruce or fir two-by-three , 8 feet 2 screw eyes 3 screw hooks 2 S-hooks 4 single pulleys 1 double pulley 1 5/16-inch-diameter nylon rope , 100 feet 1 5/8-inch drywall screws 3-inch drywall screws Wall cleat Materials cost : approximately 70 Step by Step Cut the boards for the kayak cradle . Using 1 5/8-inch drywall screws , attach the one-by-fours to the two-by-three braces ( Photo . 1 , opposite ) . The distance between the braces should equal a third of the overall length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart Bore 1/2-inch-diameter holes 3 inches from both ends of each brace .

Using the illustration above as a guide , mark the locations of all the screw eyes and screw hooks on the one-by-four cleat . Bore 5/32-inch-diameter pilot holes , then install the two screw eyes and three screw hooks . Tie the first rope to the screw eye positioned at the left end of the cleat ( Photo 2 ) . Slide two single pulleys onto the rope . Let the first pulley hang down ; place the second pulley onto the first screw hook ( Photo 3 ) .

Attach the other sling in a similar manner . Finally , fasten a metal rope cleat to the wall nearest to the back end of the trapeze . Slowly pull down on both ropes to raise the kayak . If the trapeze is tilted , pull on one rope to adjust the kayak to a level position . Once you get the kayak into the position you desire , securely tie off the ropes to the metal wall cleat .

Fasten the cleats to the ceiling with 3-inch screws ; space the cleats 381/2 inches apart . Before driving in the screws , drill a 5/32-inch-diameter pilot hole through the cleat , then bore a 1/4-inch-deep recess with a 5/8-inch-diameter spade bit . ( This ensures the 3-inch screws will go at least 1 inch into the ceiling joists . ) Use a cordless drill to screw the cleats to the joists ( Photo 2 ) . Measure 11/2 inches from one end of each threaded rod and affix a piece of tape . Carefully thread the rods into the tee-nut holes bored in the two-by-four cleats ( Photo 3 ) . Stop turning each rod when its tape " flag " makes contact with the cleat . Cut the shelves from 3/4-inch AC fir plywood .

A Bench for all Seasons THIS BUILD-IT-YOURSELF WORKBENCH is specifically designed to give you a place to reload shells , clean firearms , tie flies , refinish gun stocks , repair equipment and store a wide assortment of tools , supplies and accessories . Constructed primarily out of two-by-fours and plywood , the rock-solid workbench features a spacious 30-by-72-inch top , a rugged cast-iron vise , a replaceable work surface , a lower supply shelf , an upper tool shelf and a wall-mounted pegboard panel . Note that we permanently bolted a reloading press to the front edge of the bench , and , for extra versatility , attached a cast-iron vise to the left end .

Fasten together 2 two-by-fours to form each leg using a cordless drill and 21/2-inch-long drywall screws ( Photo 1 ) . To ensure the screws go in easily -- and do n't split the wood -- drill 5/32-inch pilot holes first . Use the same size screws to join the assembled legs to the bench 's two-by-four frame ( Photo 2 ) . From pine one-by-four stock , cut the five boards that form the supports for the lower supply shelf . Attach the one-by-fours to the inside of the legs with 1 5/8-inch drywall screws ( Photo 3 ) ; position the supports 12 inches up from the floor . Cut 2 two-by-four cross braces for the bench top .

Measure and cut pine one-by-fives for the trim that goes around the bench top . If your local home center or lumberyard does n't carry one-by-fives , which measure 3/4 inch thick by 4 1/2 inches wide , use one-by-sixes . ( If you like you can rip down the one-by-sixes to 41/2 inches , but it 's not necessary . ) Fasten the pine trim to the bench 's two-by-four frame using carpenter 's glue and 1 5/8-inch drywall screws ( Photo 6 , previous page ) . Note that it 's important to allow the trim to protrude 1/4 inch above the plywood top in order to create a shallow recess for the replaceable hardboard ( Masonite ) work surface . Cut the tempered hardboard panel to fit within the raised lip of the protruding one-by-five trim , then slide it onto the plywood top ( Photo 7 ) . The hardboard panel does n't get screwed or nailed down , making it easy to replace should it get badly stained or damaged . Use 1-inch screws to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be sure the 16-inch-wide backsplash projects 111/2 inches above the bench top . Build and assemble the 701/2-inch-long tool shelf from pine one-by-eights . Attach the three 103/4-inch-tall legs to the shelf with 2-inch screws . Set the assembled shelf into place on the bench top ( Photo 8 ) and secure it by driving 1-inch screws through the rear of the backsplash . Cut the 3/4-inch plywood lower shelf to size and install it beneath the bench top . Secure it to the one-by-four supports with 1 5/8-inch screws . Now , prepare to install the cast-iron vise by first using a sabre saw to cut a 21/2-inch-deep notch into the end of the workbench . Place the vise into the notch ( Photo 9 ) , making sure it fits flush with the bench top , then screw it to the bench as shown in the installation directions , which come with the vise.Mount the Pegboard Use a portable circular saw to cut the 4-by-8-foot pegboard sheet down to 38 by 701/2 inches . Then , cut four pieces of one-by-two to create a-perimeter frame around the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 1-inch screws ( Photo 10 ) . Next , hold the panel in place against the wall and fasten it to the wall studs with 2-inch screws ( Photo 11 ) . If you 're dealing with a poured-concrete or concrete-block wall , you 'll have to drill holes with a carbide-tipped masonry bit , tap lead anchors into the holes and drive the screws into the anchors . Once the pegboard is installed , slide the assembled workbench into place and push it up against the wall . The bottom edge of the pegboard will extend down 2 inches behind the bench 's backsplash , leaving a clean , neat joint . The double two-by-four legs and beefed-up perimeter frame create a workbench that 's sturdy , substantial and amazingly strong . If you wish to make it immovable , secure it to the wall with lag screws driven through the rear legs . Boxes and Storage cases provided by Plano Molding Co.

Flagging a mere handful of rivers you ought to fish before you get to that big one in the sky is like playing travel agent for an angler who tells you he 's got two weeks off and wants to fish a " great " stream someplace . Maybe for you a great river is one where you measure the fish from your shoulder to your fingertips . Maybe it 's a place where a small brookie is a trophy but you 're the only person there , or a place where bass swarm like piranhas on a stuck pig . Perhaps it 's an exotic river in a strange land as far from home and work as you can get . If money and time were no object , I 'd send you to rivers in western and eastern Russia , to Chile and Argentina , to both islands of New Zealand and to Brazil 's Rio Negro , where your lures or flies would be savaged by thug-faced peacock bass . Realistically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , so you 're getting my picks -- supported by input from a few of my world-traveled , hardcore fishing cronies -- of the 10 rivers you really should fish on this continent . There will be howls of disagreement , of course . But the rivers selected here are those of great historical importance to us as anglers . In addition to breath-catching beauty , many have an amazing variety of species , and , if you hit them right , the fishing can be incredible . SNAKE RIVER // Hells Canyon , Idaho/Oregon This is adrenaline-rush country . Had they chosen to shoot the 1994 thriller The River Wild on this run of the Snake instead of the Rogue , Meryl Streep would likely have quite on the spot . The rapids are maelstroms where jet boats and gutsy rafters slalom between giant boulders and 8-foot standing waves . Once , after surviving one of those rapids to reach the graceful , powerful fishing water , I pried Pat McManus 's whitened fingers from the boat 's gunwale and thrust a rod into his hand . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed it to the uncontrollable twitch that had developed in his arm . As a younger man , G. Loomis 's executive director Bruce Holt cut his teeth on bronzebacks here . " Let a spinner tipped with pork flutter into the shadows of those big boulders and a bass would smack , " he says . " We caught so many we just did n't tell anyone because nobody would believe it . " The rainbows in the river are especially good in summer , and steelhead are prime fall through winter . White sturgeon here reach 10 feet and can wreck you . You 'll find catfish , too . The canyon is the deepest in North America . Only three roads access this river sector . Consider a combo fishing/chukar hunt trip in fall . Lodging and RV sites are available .

YELLOWSTONE RIVER // Montana Years back , the late , great guide Ray Hurley drove around on fishing trips in a converted ambulance . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee Jim Canyon with him , I wondered if it was still first-aid-equipped . We were catching rainbows , browns and cutthroats , and although I knew that the truly big fish would be squatting behind the boulders , we were focused on just getting through . The stretch of Yellowstone from Gardiner to the Canyon and then down to Tom Miner Creek is powerful water best fished from a boat , though during lower levels it 's possible to wade a bit . The Yellowstone is arguably the most varied trout river in North America , and at 670 miles long it 's the only undammed major river in the Lower 48 . The headwaters and its small tributaries hold lovely cutthroat trout that you 'll have to work to reach . The town of Livingston is the river 's nerve center , and talk of fishing fills the air in every eatery and saloon . In fact , you 'll find fine fishing just east of town in braided channels and riffles . Except for Yankee Jim Canyon , the nearly 60-mile stretch from Gardiner down to the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's also the most popular stretch . Find solitude by targeting the broad , huge-riffled section from Sheep Mountain to below Big Timber . From mid-April into early May , this stretch explodes with caddis hatches so prolific you 'll literally inhale the things . The best area for the giant salmonfly hatch in early July is between Gardiner and Emigrant . Contact : Dan Bailey 's Fly Shop , 800-356-4052 . CLARKS FORK // Montana Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone offers marvelous angling in its small headwater tributaries for those willing to explore beyond the established trails . Macauley Lord , L.L. Bean 's chief casting instructor , calls the tributaries " pure gold , where a ten-inch brookie is a trophy " and suggests hunting for the " inlets and outlets of tiny glacial ponds , which can run thick with trout . " A nameless , woods-protected outflow harbors large rainbows in fairly wide water . " One tiny outlet from a large lake should be seen from the east near sunset , " says Lord . " In the roar of the stream 's thousand-foot plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sun and you 'll see only the fins of large cutthroat and brook trout glowing in silhouette . " Contact : Dan Bailey 's Fly Shop , 800-356-4052 . HENRYS FORK // Idaho From the Osborne bridge to Pinehaven , including Harriman State Park , Henrys Fork is a gigantic spring " creek " with soft water , fecund insect hatches and hefty rainbow trout . During the June green drake hatch it can be crowded , though mostly by the courteous . The trout find life easy and are as fickle as debutantes . Newcomers sometimes confuse rising native whitefish with the cavalier trout . I delight in the story Mike Lawson , the undisputed dean of Henrys Fork , once told about his early days here . " One time I worked on this big bank feeder maybe twenty minutes , " he said . As he reeled in his catch , he made an unpleasant discovery . " Whitefish ! By golly ! " Mike 's basso profundo voice grew to operatic volume . " I like ta squeeze his dang face clean off ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box Canyon , but Henrys Fork has many other areas where you 'll find more elbowroom . From Riverside Campground ( a good spot to stay ) to Warm River , the river receives little pressure . You can hike in via Forest Service roads but you 'll need to negotiate a steep canyon down and back . The canyon opens below the Warm , with road access to good brown trout that fall for streamers later in season or stonefly imitations early in June . The Warm River is a good back-country tributary , ideal for fishing with your family , as is the Buffalo . The Fork 's other major tribs -- the Fall and Teton rivers -- are blue-ribbon trout waters , too . The tailwater section below Ashton dam past St. Anthony to the Snake has excellent fishing . Mid-June through early July , Gray Drake spinners bring up big trout here while most anglers are casting Green Drakes at the Ranch . By the Memorial Day opener , stonefly hatches have normally begun . Below St. Anthony is beautiful braid water , but access is permission-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800-788-4479 . KENAI RIVER // Alaska The Kenai River pierces its namesake peninsula like an aquamarine sliver of glass en route to the huge Cook Inlet . The river gushes from Kenai Lake , passes through Skilak Lake and runs largely along the Sterling Highway . Such road access is rare for the 49th state and gives anglers a taste of Alaska fishing without fly-ins . But the easy access results in shoulder-to-shoulder salmon angling that 's often described as combat fishing . I prefer floating the Kenai 's smaller upper water for huge Dolly Vardens and spectacular rainbow trout that can break the 30-inch mark . From May through July thousands of giant king salmon enter the river , and from below Skilak Lake on downstream into big , deep water , hundreds of anglers hunt them . They drift roe and Spin-N-Glows and troll big plugs . Fish weighting 25 to 45 pounds are common . A 97-pound beast is the record , and dreams of a 100-pounder keep many anglers coming back for another try . The 18 river miles from Kenai Lake to Skilak Lake , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is where OL Photo Editor Cherie Cincilla was hopelessly spoiled cutting her flyfishing teeth on armlength Dollies , a place where you expect solitude , floating in motorless rafts or drifts boats . This stretch also has decent road access . When the season opens in June , smolt-pattern flies , sculpins , buggers and green Muddlers are all good . By August the Dollies and rainbows are chomping sock-eye eggs and becoming more and more color-selective . Leeches , buggers and sculpins can also bring satisfying results in September , and downstream of snags , try casting some ginger/blonde flesh flies .

Each section is different and each is best fished at different times . The upper river fishes well in spring . Late September through October pig trout swim from Hebgen Lake and eat big streamers . The lower river below Ennis Lake is a shallow , weedy tailwater best fished fall throuh winter into June . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- known as the 50-Mile Riffle -- that owns the hearts of most anglers . " Floating from Varney Bridge to Ennis is a visual spectacle that makes my neck hair stand up , " says Scientific Anglers line wizard Bruce Richards . Since the Madison 's wonderful recovery from the whirling disease blight in the ' 90s , the river can get crowded . Heed a tip from Fly Fisherman editor and publisher John Randolph : " Pennsylvania angling master George Harvey learned how to nail quality water in the midst of fishing pressure , " he says . " Ease into the water and fish only the first three feet from the bank and you 'll have your own channel , unless some wader has chased the fish briefly to deeper water .

Their favorite waters had all blown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bighorn from Afterbay Dam were still clear . The Bighorn 's year-round consistency is legendary . You can fish it any season . April to May sees more pressure because of intense midge hatches . There 's hopper action late summer into September . Subsurface scuds , sow bugs and worm imitations take fish all the time . Streamers are great , too , as are mini crankbaits . " The Bighorn 's population of rainbows and browns has declined with Western drought and reduced flows , " says Fly Fisherman 's John Randolph , " but the good news is that average trout size is up and angler numbers have decreased . The river has lost none of its glitter for me . " In autumn the Bighorn is swarming with waterfowl . Rooster pheasants cackle raucously at dawn , and big brown trout will attack almost anything .

Everything that lives in Lake Michigan is likely to swim its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pike and even sturgeon are there for the catching . The big draws are salmon and lake-run steelhead that run as far upstream as Tippy Dam near Wellston . If you intend to chase these species and want to avoid the worst of the fishing pressure , do n't fish the peak weekends in April or from mid-September to mid-November , although weekdays during these periods are n't bad . Try fishing a mile or so from Tippy Dam for less competition . Trout are another story . I 've relished wonderful trout fishing solitude within the Manistee National Forest with outfitter Ray Schmidt from below Hodenpyl Dam down to Tippy . Browns are found throughout the river and you can target holdover rainbows in the upper waters and brookies in the tributaries . You can backpack in , camp and fish here . Above Hodenpyl , the upper-river reaches south of Mancelona hold beautiful brook trout beneath brushy cover . " Really big trout are in tailwater sections , " says Scientific Anglers ' Bruce Richards . " A boat is good to have in the broader water from Tippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually as a tandem rig incorporating a stonefly nymph . Anything can happen in the lower river , though .

" Petroglyphs of the Anasazi on six-hundred-foot-tall crimson sandstone walls ; the raw , exposed geological history of the planet ; the memories of ten-pound trout .

Barbless hooks are required for all . Stalk shallow fish from mid-November into March . Then in mid-March , midge hatches catch fire as trout move into runs and riffles .

There are browns here , too . The lower Kennebec from Bath down to the ocean has captured my heart with its great runs of striped bass from May through September and the pushes of voracious bluefish in July . Broad and deep , with powerful currents , the lower river can be sly and quiet or explode into a whitecapped maelstrom of fighting wind and tide . It can wrap you in impenetrable fog one moment and spit you out into bright skies and shoulder-baking sun the next . You can fish any of a number of ways here , from natural baits or light-tackle Slug-Gos to surface poppers or deeply sunken streamer flies . A potpourri of guides fish the river in everything from flats skiffs to small cabin craft . This is Maine 's undisputed queen of striper rivers .

##2001069 See also additional image(s) in Table of Contents file of same issue . Why do elephants knock over trees ? Because they can . At least that 's the impression I 'm left with as I look over the high arid savanna in north-central Namibia , where a seemingly unending swath of trees has been uprooted and torn apart by the 15 or so elephants that call this area home . It 's hard to believe that so few animals can dish out so much destruction ; it looks like a tornado has passed through . These elephants may have a motive for their mayhem , however . The effort they put into destroying Mt . Etjo 's largest trees might in fact be a prefight conditioning program of sorts . Recently , three rhinos were found dead here after battling with Mt . Etjo 's elephants . Their remains and the tracks in the dirt left by the combatants tell the tale . The great pachyderms periodically square off and batter each other , but the elephants have the advantage . Using their 11,000 pounds of crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly impenetrable hides , lean into their adversaries and slowly grind the life out of them . It 's not that the rhinos are helpless in these battles . A hideous gash that unzipped the front of one elephant 's leg from the footpad to the knee reveals the murderous power behind the rhino 's thrusting horn . But the fact remains that the score in these encounters so far is elephants three , rhinos zero . When we ask why the elephants seem intent on fighting with the rhinos , Naftali Amoolongo , our professional hunting guide , shakes his head and simply says , " They crazy . " The big brutes have left Naftali in a somewhat sour mood this morning as we drive along the sandy roads surrounding Mt . Etjo looking for game . Every so often a tree with a shattered trunk lies across our path and we have to jump off the hunting buggy to muscle it out of the way . With the rocks and boulders the elephants toss into the roads -- another aspect of their training , perhaps -- we simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn elephants , " Naftali says after we clear our way through another road-block . Actually , he often says quite a bit more when offering his opinions on the world 's largest land animal , but his colorful vocabulary is n't fit to print here . Eddie Kaerua , our tracker , has his own reservations about the elephants -- the rhinos , too , for that matter . Not much of a talker , Eddie is visibly jumpy as we exit our truck to track down a group of gemsboks we saw earlier . One impressive bull had caught our attention . We last saw the small herd disappearing into the thick tangle of thorn bushes that now surrounds us . Eddie is n't thrilled to be hunting this particular piece of ground on the 60,000-acre game reserve where my father and I have booked a weeklong hunt . In addition to our gemsboks , several elephants and some black rhinos have been spotted here lately . Their tracks and droppings and the remains of the vegetation they 've destroyed are everywhere . " I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant . It 's no good , " Eddie says as the four of us prepare to follow the gemsboks and hopefully secure the nice bull for my father . Naftali suggests I bring along my .416 Rigby , just in case . Role Reversal Fathers and sons hunting together is a longtime sporting tradition . But while children usually learn to hunt from a parent , with my dad and me the roles are reversed . I learned to hunt on my own years ago and over time introduced my father to upland bird hunting and waterfowling , both of which he really enjoys . But with the exception of an abortive attempt to hunt elk some time back -- a comedy of errors that deserves its own story -- we have never chased big game together . In fact , the gemsbok we are stalking is only the second big-game animal my father has seriously hunted . The first was a springbok , a dainty member of the antelope family no larger than a smallish white-tail doe , that he shot just the day before . As I watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black thorn trees , attempting to mimic the fluid and silent motions of our tracker and PH , I 'm nervous as hell . It is n't the elephants I 'm worried about . More than anything , I want my dad to enjoy hunting and Africa as much as I do . Then he glances over his shoulder , and his grin tells me he 's having the time of his life . After snaking through the bush for about half an hour , we close the gap on the gemsboks . Though we are rarely able to see more than 25 yards in any direction , Naftali maneuvers us into position to view the rapier-horned animals through a break in the vegetation . They file past us one by one about 70 yards away , their black horns glinting in the sunlight and bushy tails swishing against their gray and tawny flanks . Finally the last animal in line , the herd bull , steps into view . Naftali makes a loud cowlike moan , freezing the bull in mid-stride . He swings his head our way , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that gives the species its name . My father , set up on shooting sticks , drops him with a single shot from his .30/06 . Watching this picture-perfect hunting scenario unfold , a wave of satisfaction sweeps through me . I feel as proud as , well , a father . We rush up to the animal . My dad 's bullet , a 180-grain Winchester Fail Safe , took him through both lungs . The bull stumbled less than 20 yards after the shot before falling over . As we approach , Naftali tells us to stay out of range of his formidable horns and to keep our rifles trained on the animal . " He 's not dead , " Naftali says . " Look ! Do you see its hair ? It is flat . When the bull dies , the hair will stand up . " I stare closely at the animal , fascinated . The bull is on its side , completely still , but a moment later I see the hair along its flank flare slightly . Naftali relaxes and thumps my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naftali 's Secrets As Naftali guts the bull before loading it in the back of our truck , I ask him where he learned the trick about the hair . " The Bushmen taught me -- it is one of their secrets , " he says . " It happens with all animals at the moment they die . " He then tells me how Bushmen will take the pulp from an animal 's stomach and smear it over their bodies to mask their scent when hunting . And then he really surprises me by teaching me how to take a drink of water out of a slain animal . Gemsboks , like other ungulates , have four-chambered stomachs . The first and largest chamber contains the most recognizable mash of plants . If you take a handful of the mash and squeeze it , the liquid that pours out is water . Granted , it has a slight manure odor to it , but Naftali insists it wo n't make you sick and , in a desperate situation , could save your life . I try squeezing out some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naftali explains that in the village where he grew up his father would let Bushmen , who are among the last primitive nomadic hunters on earth , camp on his small plot of land during periods of drought or when game was scarce . Because his father shared his water with them , they became frequent guests and Naftali would spend much of his time playing with their boys , who were about his age . By the time he was 10 , Naftali started hunting with them , using the simple homemade bows they carried to bring down all kinds of game . Under their guidance he learned to stalk , track , make his own hunting tools and live off the land . Tracking Kudu A couple of days after my father took his gemsbok , we spot a group of mature kudu bulls feeding among some trees . We drive past them , park the truck and start stalking . Eddie , our tracker , has come down with the flu , so it 's just Naftali , my dad and me . The three of us spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground to get within range . We slowly crawl from one scrawny bush to the next , freezing in place for minutes at a time when it seems we have attracted the attention of the bulls . As exposed as we are , the bulls are nearly impossible to see within the thicket where they feed . Every so often I spot one or two of their magnificent spiral horns waving back and forth in the bushes as the animals browse , but that 's about it . In any event , we do n't get a shot ; whether the wind betrays us or one of our boots scrapes too loudly on the dirt , the bulls finally bolt . Naftali walks up to the animals ' tracks , looks them over and decides that the kudu were n't panicked and that we should follow . The speed with which an African tracker can cover ground is astonishing . For one , the marks left by the hooves in the hard dirt are relatively indistinct to begin with . For another , the number of tracks that Naftali has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zebra , impala and a dozen others , not to mention those left by other kudu -- seem to make following our bulls an impossible task . Yet we swiftly trot after the animals as if they had dipped their hooves in paint . We travel at least a couple of miles before Naftali calls it off . The bulls , sensing our pressure , have finally broken into a determined canter and there 's no way for us to catch up . On the way back from the busted stalk we move down a dry , sandy riverbed and come across the unmistakable footprints of a group of elephants . Not long after , we see three of them moving through the bush headed in our direction . We 're still a long way from the truck , but with the wind in our favor they amble by as harmless as 11-foot-tall dairy cows . Learning The Ropes As our week in Namibia draws to a close , my father and I have taken nearly all the game we 've come for . We 've each shot a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Best of all , he 's clearly hooked on Africa . Without question , our safari has been a success . Finding a good gemsbok for me would be a bonus . Driving around Mt . Etjo , we see hundreds of animals , including one of the elusive black rhinos that Oelofse has reintroduced to the land . We look over dozens of gemsboks on the way . Even though the females of the species have the longest horns , I really want to take one of the thick-horned males , along the lines of my father 's 38-incher . During the last day I get my chance . As we drive , we glimpse a small bachelor group of gemsboks . One seems to be a good bull . The animals dart into some nearby bush and Naftali and I start after them on foot , moving fast . The sun is getting low is the sky and we want to make the most of our remaining light . The bulls zig and zag in front of us , staying mostly out of sight in the thick cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving underneath the brush , but that is about it . We play this game of hide-and-seek for about 20 minutes until we approach an area where the vegetation starts to thin . Naftali suddenly sprints ahead , curving away from the bulls . I run with him , and when he stops , he hastily sets up the shooting sticks and I get my rifle ready . " I think they 'll come this way , " Naftali whispers to me , and sure enough I could see the bulls moving about 100 yards in front of us . " I think the bull you want is the second one in line -- but I 'm not certain , " he says , looking slightly worried . I tell him not to be concerned , that the bull will be fine , no matter what its horns are like . And I mean it . We have a narrow lane to shoot through and when the second bull appears , Naftali gives his cow-moan . The moment the bull stops I pull the trigger . The bull lurches , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him and see that he is gorgeous -- heavy-horned and stately . The bull kicks for a minute , goes still . Then I see its hair stand up . Naftali notices what I 'm looking at and says with a smile , " You 're learning ! " Yes , I am . And I ca n't wait for the next opportunity to see what Africa will teach me . WHY THE .416 ? When I first booked this plains-game hunt , I was n't planning to take my .416 Rigby ( Namibia 's wide-open terrain seemed more suited to one of the souped-up , flat-shooting .30s ) , but I 'm glad I did . This rifle has several advantages that really worked in its favor on this safari . My kudu ( above ) was a case in point . Accuracy and Balance : First , my Ruger Magnum is a wonderfully accurate rifle that will give cloverleaf groups off the bench . Its balance and weight ( 111/2 pounds with scope ) make it a steady and easy gun to shoot quickly off-hand , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When I spotted my bull , he was walking fast about 100 yards from where I stood . As I swung the rifle , the heavy barrel kept the crosshairs tracking in a smooth line with his chest . I hit him twice -- both bullets ran through his vitals and exited next to each other in front of the off shoulder . With a lighter rifle those shots would have been trickier . New Ammo : I used Federal 's new .416 load tipped with 400-grain Nosler Partitions , a devastating combination of bullet and caliber that can handle every huntable animal on the planet with the exception of the thickest-skinned dangerous game . Sighted 3 inches high at 100 yards , this bullet is dead on at 200 yards and drops only 11 inches at 300 yards -- plenty flat enough for every hunting situation I encountered .
