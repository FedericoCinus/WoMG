It 's the toes and fingertips that still are a little numb . <p> - With the signing of Alfonso <p> Soriano , among others , the Cubs have increased their payroll . Which tends to increase expectations . As well as ticket prices . <p> - The White Sox ' willingness to trade for younger pitching provides some stability -- for the team 's payroll . It 's a situation that raises hopes for Sox brass . And somehow ticket prices , too . <p> - The Associated Press reports the Serbian town of Zitiste plans " to erect a huge statue of Sylvester Stallone 's Rocky Balboa film character in the village square to attract tourists and show a new face to the world . " And -- unlike some in Hollywood -- this new face will not require the help of a cosmetic surgeon . <p> - Russell Crowe is ridding the Australian rugby team he owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what Quick Hits thought cheerleaders are supposed to be . <p> - The New York Post says , " The dress code is all-black for newly single Michael Jordan 's 44th birthday party Saturday in Las Vegas with burlesque dancers and body-painted nude models entertaining such guests as Eva Longoria , Sean Combs and Usher . " <p> Meaning it sounds much more interesting than some of the events that will be televised from the NBA 's All-Star Weekend . <p> PICTURE THIS : ANNA 'S EXHIBITION TONIGHT <p> You read it here first . <p> Or did n't . <p> There is no Anna Kournikova item today , thereby ending a streak in which she had appeared for two consecutive weeks in this space . Accompanied , of course , by a non-gratuitous photo . <p> There will be no mention that she is scheduled to appear in a tennis exhibition at 7:30 tonight at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates . Similarly , there will be no mention of the likelihood of the longtime Quick Hits favorite and yours truly actually meeting . <p> There will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she holds some Quick Hits clips . Mainly because final arrangements are being worked on at this very moment as her people and Quick Hits ' people ( OK , so QH does n't really have people ; do n't tell her people ) work out the details . And , OK , so it 's not really her people , but more like people with whom her people have a working relationship . <p> Anyway , if Quick Hits can find Hoffman Estates ( and that 's a big " if " ) , there might be an Anna Kournikova item in Tuesday 's paper . And perhaps a photo . <p> THE REX CARD : RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON GROSSMAN <p> Conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh applied his own brand of media criticism liberally in the aftermath of the Bears ' Super Bowl XLI loss : <p> " I got ta get something off my chest , " he said on his radio show last week . " You know , the game was the game , and the game was what it was , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're writing his name W-r-e-c-k-s , saying he was the worst quarterback ever to play in the Super Bowl , and it 's been like this since the Green Bay game -- actually , since the Arizona game . There was a little crescendo of it in the Green Bay game , the last game of the season for the Bears , and it 's just unrelenting . <p> " They 're focusing on this guy like they do n't focus on anybody -- and I 'll tell you , I know what it is . The media , the sports <p> media , have got social concerns that they are first and foremost interested in , and they 're dumping on this guy , Rex Grossman , for one reason , folks , and that 's because he is a white quarterback . " <p> Well , that explains everything . <p> QUOTEWORTHY : <p> " Reach 91 . " <p> Dom Dimaggio , former Boston Red Sox outfielder , who turns 90 today , on his goals <p> MISS MATCH : ILLINOIS BEAUTY QUEEN KNOWS THE SCORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . <p> You think this job is easy ( that 's a rhetorical question , meaning you 're not supposed to answer -- <p> especially if the response is going to be an emphatic " yes " ) ? <p> Nothing better to do than wait in the office Sunday afternoon for Miss Illinois 2006 Heidi Ekstrom to call from the Chicago Shamrox indoor lacrosse contest , where she was the honored guest at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates . <p> And she came through in the clutch . <p> With the phone call , if not the result . <p> " Right now the score is 3-1 , Buffalo Bandits are winning , " Mundelein native Ekstrom , 24 , told Quick Hits . <p> So much for being a good-luck charm . She 'll have to work on it . <p> " It 's only the first quarter . " <p> Her charms failed this time . <p> Final score : Bandits 12 , Shamrox 11 . <p> Ekstrom 's sports background ? <p> " I played soccer in high school , and my dad 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of runs in the family . " <p> How 's her lacrosse knowledge these days ? <p> " Not too good . I 'm learning . " <p> When she does have sufficient knowledge to explain the sport , maybe she will give Quick Hits another call . <p> PICK AND ROLL : HONDO SEES CELTS IN ODEN 'S FUTURE <p> With the Boston Celtics doing their best to do their worst , they may be in line for a big change . <p> As in Greg Oden . <p> The Celtics have the worst record in the NBA , meaning they could be in good position if the Ohio State freshman center enters the NBA draft . He is expected to be the No. 1 pick . <p> Former Buckeyes and Boston star John Havlicek would n't mind seeing Oden end up a Celtic . <p> " Why not ? " said Havlicek , who attended OSU 's home victory Saturday against Purdue that featured the school honoring former captains such as himself . " Can you think of anyone else in the country who 's a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-point , nine-rebound game was the first time Havlicek had seen him in person . <p> The Celtics ' poor play has some fans looking to see whether Oden will say , " Goodbye Columbus " after one season . <p> " Oh , yeah . ' The Oden Sweepstakes , " ' Havlicek chuckled . " But that does n't mean anything because we were supposed to get Tim Duncan in the 1997 draft and he went to the Spurs . We 've had a string of bad luck , and maybe it 's about to change .

##3065251 <p> If there was a theme among the major winners as the 49th annual Grammy Awards were handed out last night in Los Angeles , it was women persevering against the odds and coming out on top . <p> Country-pop trio the Dixie Chicks claimed five Grammys : song , record and album of the year , best country performance by a group and best country album . The wins seemed like vindication after many gigs on last year 's tour were cancelled in Red states , where fans continue to boycott the singers because of their political statements . <p> " To quote the great Simpsons : ' Ha ha ! , ' " lead vocalist Natalie Maines said when claiming the song of the year statue . Later , accepting album of the year , she elaborated . <p> " I think people are using their freedom of speech here tonight with all these awards , " Maines said . <p> " I think people were using their voice the same way this loudmouth did . " <p> Mary J. Blige had eight nominations and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best R &B; song and best R &B; album . But the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul viewed the wins as public redemption after years of personal turmoil . <p> " For so many years , I 've been talked about negatively , and this time I am being talked about positively , " Blige said . Later , she added , " I do n't think you can have a great peak if you have n't had a valley , because it 's in the valley where you find out who you really are . " <p> Also among the night 's big winners -- though less deserving than the ladies -- were punk- funksters turned soggy balladeers the Red Hot Chili Peppers , whose wins included best rock album , best performance by a group with vocal and best rock song . <p> Rapper Lupe Fiasco had topped the list of Chicago nominees , but he lost in all three of his categories . This was especially disappointing in the best rap album contest , since the winner , Ludacris , was announced by two Chicago rap superstars : Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner : power-pop band OK Go , which won best shortform music video for " Here It Goes Again . " <p> With 97 of the 108 Grammy categories presented during the non-televised ceremony before the broadcast , the show had less to do with the actual awards than ever . Instead , viewers got 3 1/2 hours of a mainstream variety show wishing it was " American Idol . " <p> Last year , when the awards moved to Wednesday , Simon Cowell &; Co. drew 32 million viewers , while only 17 million tuned into the Grammys . This year , the Grammys moved back to Sunday to avoid the competition , and they tried to take some " Idol " tricks with them . <p> The " Grammy Moment " contest invited viewers to vote for one of three unsigned , previously unknown singers -- all of them model-beautiful anorexic young women , introduced by Chicago 's <p> Jennifer Hudson -- to duet with Justin Timberlake . The idea had nothing to do with the Recording Academy 's stated purpose for the awards -- " to honor excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " -- and it was a slap in the face to all of the winners and performers excluded from the broadcast . <p> In another nod to the immensely popular " American Idol , " Carrie Underwood claimed the prestigious best new artist Grammy , in addition to best female country vocal and best country song <p> ( " Jesus , Take the Wheel " ) . She also peformed as part of a glossy new country tribute to the Eagles that was exceeded in its lameness only by James Blunt crooning " You 're Beautiful . " <p> Of the other performances , the much-hyped reunion by the Police turned out to be anticlimactic . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen , we are the Police , and we 're back ! " Sting said , laying the foundation for a summer tour that will be the band 's first since 1984 . But the still-peroxide-blond trio delivered only one song , " Roxanne , " rendering the early single in the style of Sting 's solo versions , complete with a pointless jazzy interlude . The group seemed to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy it displayed during the New Wave era . <p> Another surprising disappointment was Gnarls Barkley 's irresistible " Crazy , " which Cee-Lo Green and DJ Danger Mouse inexplicably rendered as a march at half the speed of the recorded version . <p> ( The group was shut out of the major categories but won best alternative album and best urban/alternative performance . ) <p> On the plus side : Christina Aguilera 's barn-burning performance of James Brown 's " It 's a Man 's , <p> Man 's , Man 's World " and Chris Brown 's display of rhythmic step dancing . <p> e-mail : jimdero@jimdero.com <p> THE BIG WINNERS : <p> Best new artist <p> Carrie Underwood <p> James Blunt Chris Brown Imogen Heap Corinne Bailey Rae Song of the year " Not Ready to Make Nice " Dixie Chicks " You 're Beautiful " James Blunt " Be Without You " Mary J.

##3065253 <p> We call them one-leggers , " Phil Hofmann said . Trust me , lovebirds , you do n't want to be one . And forget Dr. Phil . Dr. Dale , the Caster of Love Nets , is in the house . Pull up close and pay attention . <p> Valentine 's Day arrives Wednesday , just in time for the Midwest Fishing Report . And no , inviting your wife or significant other to join you inside your Fish Trap ice shelter on Lake Marie is not a romantic option ( save for the very , very lucky few ) . <p> Hofmann had the look of somebody who has been around a time or two when I collared the salesman at the Fox Lake Harbor booth at the Chicago Boat , RV &; Outdoors Show at McCormick Place in January . <p> " I 've had very few one-leggers , maybe half a dozen , over the years , " said Hofmann , who has sold at boat shows for some 20 years . " A one-legger is somebody that says , ' My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> Dr. Dale 's first lesson in love : The wrong kind of surprise is all wrong . <p> Guys , if you 're going out to buy that big-ticket recreational item -- vacation land , family boat , family cabin , vacation condo on the lake or RV -- make it a full-blown family trip and decision . <p> The one exception to this rule is guys generally are allowed to buy fishing boats strictly on their own . ( I emphasize generally . Know your spouse or significant other before assuming this exception applies . ) <p> Ladies , Dr. Dale 's second lesson in love is for you : Steak , cold beer and sex are good , but Blain 's Farm and Fleet has more variety . <p> You ca n't go wrong with giving your guy a hundred bucks and a couple of free hours at the nearest Farm and Fleet . <p> ( Any woman who figures out what it is about Farm and Fleet that makes it so attractive to guys will be far ahead of the field . I 'll give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home page , is a " Your Ice Fishing Headquarters " ad right next to a " Start Your Registry " ad . ) <p> The auxiliary to this lesson is that Dick 's Sporting Goods , Cabela 's , Bass Pro Shops and Gander Mountain often deliver nearly the same ecstasy as roaming the aisles of Farm and Fleet . <p> The greatest gift my wife ever gave me was a gift certificate to Henry 's Sports &; Bait . It was only $35 or $50 , and I think I only used it to get a couple of Frenzy crankbaits and a few packs of soft plastics , but the idea that she understood me enough to know I would love it made it a perfect gift . <p> That brings me to the third in the trinity of Dr. Dale 's love lessons : <p> Forget knowing yourself ; know your other . <p> Guys , trust me on this , do n't buy your other a size-2 teddy and expect to be showered with love . ( For starters , I 've been told on good authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And the auxiliary to this is the general idea that guys are better off not buying their lovers clothing , period . <p> And ladies , also trust me on this , the same auxiliary applies to buying your guys fishing rods or hunting stuff . Unless you understand the difference between G.Loomis and St. Croix or what No. 71/2 lead shot is used for as opposed to BBB steel , do n't even think of buying a fishing rod or hunting stuff . <p> Because most of Dr. Dale 's readers are guys , here 's a final piece of advice from Hofmann . The veteran salesman was talking about selling boats , but it applies more broadly : " She can nix the deal . Unless you get her excited , it ai n't going anywhere .

##3065254 <p> Bob Chmiel , who recruited high school football players for four major colleges during a 28-year coaching career , recalls when the word " decommitment " was as unfamiliar to the game as the term " Bowl Championship Series . " <p> How times have changed . <p> " Until a few years ago , " Chmiel said , " the only time you heard of a kid making a commitment to one school , then changing his mind and going to another school was when the head coach was fired or went elsewhere . That was perfectly acceptable and understandable . But now ... " <p> The numbers are staggering , even embarrassing . Last year , nearly 100 Division I football players reneged on their initial commitments and signed at other schools . In the wake of national signing day for the class of 2007 last week , the figure is even bigger . <p> And there is no reason to believe there wo n't be more of the same next year . <p> The most publicized decommitment in recent months involved basketball star Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junior but signed with Indiana in November . <p> But the number of significant decommitments in basketball can be counted on one hand . Will Bogan , a 6-11 senior from Bell City , Mo. , shunned Memphis for Southeast Missouri State . And 6-7 Martez Walker of Mount Verde , Fla. , one of the top-rated juniors in the nation , has decommitted from Louisville and is considering Florida , Florida State and Texas . <p> " Decommitments are n't nearly as big a problem in basketball as in football , but we 're starting to see more of them recently , " said Van Coleman , a recruiting analyst for Hoopmasters.com . " By far the biggest problem in basketball is transfers , kids going from one school to another at midyear or after the first year . There have been 45 transfers so far this year . " <p> In football , Illinois got defensive lineman D'Angelo McCray ( from Florida ) but lost defensive lineman Renaldo Sagesse ( to Michigan ) and quarterback Clint Brewster ( to Minnesota ) . Sagesse had committed to coach Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brewster was understandable . He had committed to Illinois in the fall , before his father , ex-Illini tight end Tim Brewster , was named head coach at Minnesota . As late as <p> Jan. 15 , he said he was " solid " for Illinois . A week ago , he decided that blood is thicker than an oral commitment and opted for Minnesota . <p> Michigan State benefitted from two coaching moves , picking up running back Andre Anderson of Barrington ( from Minnesota ) and offensive lineman Arthur Ray Jr . of Mount Carmel ( from Boston College ) . <p> Florida added four blue-chippers to its top-ranked recruiting class -- quarterback John Brantley ( from Texas ) , linebacker Justin Trattou ( from Notre Dame ) , offensive lineman James Wilson ( from USC ) and defensive back Jerimy Finch ( from Indiana ) -- and demonstrated that a national championship can be a powerful influence . <p> Notre Dame got linebacker Brian Smith ( from Iowa ) and kicker Brandon Walker ( from Louisville ) but lost wide receiver Greg Little ( to North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Northwestern lost offensive lineman Anthony Grosso ( to Florida State ) . <p> " The Internet started it all , " Chmiel said . " There is so much information out there and so much stimuli that kids can get about various situations . I 've never seen anything like this . Now coaches sit by their fax machines on signing day and hope they 'll get signed commitments . As former college coach and current ESPN analyst Lee Corso once said : ' One hundred percent in recruiting is n't certain enough . ' <p> " What I felt was if there was a significant influence at home -- a father or mother or uncle -- who would persuade a kid to keep his word , the chances are he would n't change his mind . But I see more kids on their own more than ever before . They do n't have someone in the home that they can trust for guidance and leadership . Now there are so many outside influences . " <p> CSTV recruiting analyst Tom Lemming also traces the wave of decommitments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame to be shared by one and all -- immature athletes , undisciplined and uneducated parents and high school coaches and unethical college coaches . <p> Lemming pointed out that people call kids all day long , even after they commit ; college coaches do n't honor commitments ; the 18-year-old recruits should have enough integrity and maturity to say , " I gave my word , and I 'll stick to it " ; and parents pamper their children and send the wrong message by allowing them to keep looking . <p> " Kids feel a sense of entitlement that allows them to do what they want to do , " Lemming said . " They do n't live by other people 's rules . They feel they are special and have a right to go back on their word . If a college would drop a player , can you imagine the uproar ? " <p> So what is the answer ? Can the problem be solved ? <p> Some call for an early signing period for football , as in basketball , perhaps in July or August . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 of an athlete 's senior year . Maybe the NCAA could establish a clearinghouse , where an athlete 's oral commitment would be binding until signing day , or prohibit all recruiting until after the college season -- from Feb. 1 to April 30 . <p> " You can legislate rules , but you ca n't legislate ethics -- and that 's the problem , " said Chmiel , a Fenwick graduate who coached at Northern Illinois , Northwestern , Michigan and Notre Dame . " As long as there is an arbitrary date , people can put pressure on a kid to change his mind . <p> " If a kid says he is committed but is entertaining calls from any other school , that is n't a firm commitment . He needs someone to say it 's over , no more calls . But a coach still has to recruit a kid who has committed to him as if he has n't committed because there is so much chicanery out there . And it is n't going away .

##3065255 <p> When Isiah Thomas came down from the front office to take over as coach of the New York Knicks last summer , Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan made it clear the Knicks had to show significant progress this season or Thomas would be out as coach and team president . <p> What constitutes progress is open to interpretation -- Dolan never talked about specifics -- so Thomas ' future remains in doubt . <p> There 's little question the Knicks are better . They took a 22-28 record -- one victory short of their total for all of last season -- into their game Saturday against the Utah Jazz and no longer are the laughingstock of the league . Whether that 's enough to save Thomas ' job remains to be seen . <p> Knicks center Eddy Curry recently was asked by a couple of New York writers what his reaction would be if Thomas was fired after the season . <p> " I 'd be shocked , I 'd be ticked , I 'd be a lot of things , " Curry said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The former Bulls draft choice then was asked whether he was serious about demanding a trade if Thomas was to be fired . <p> " Definitely , " he said . " I 'd be on my way out . " <p> Thomas downplayed Curry 's statement when it was relayed to him . <p> " I thanked him for his support but also reminded him that it 's about the Knicks , " Thomas said . " It 's not about me ; it 's about us . I 'm glad he feels that way and our players feel that way , but we have a long ways to go . " <p> Whether Curry could force his way out of New York is doubtful , but he has a point about Thomas . Dumping him now does n't make sense . <p> I know Thomas is the poster boy for ineffective NBA management , but I think he has done a decent <p> job since taking over the Knicks in December 2003 .

They still are a bad team with a bloated payroll , but they now have a younger roster with a solid core of players to build around in Curry , David Lee , Channing Frye and Jamal Crawford . <p> Despite the Knicks getting off to a slow start , Thomas has done a good job of coaching this season . Unlike Larry Brown last season , Thomas has convinced guard Stephon Marbury to take on a lesser role and is starting to get everyone to play up to their capabilities . <p> The offense now runs through Curry , and the former Thornwood star was averaging 19.6 points and seven rebounds heading into the game against the Jazz . Curry credited Thomas with the improvement . <p> " Isiah , he 's good , " Curry said . " He 'll make you believe . He definitely made me a believer .

##3065256 <p> The blond locks were longer than usual last month . Looking like he should be in search of the nearest beach , outfielder Brian Anderson instead was at SoxFest , answering questions about his future . <p> More specifically , if he had one with the White Sox . <p> Anderson is coming off a rookie campaign in which he hit a dismal .225 with eight home runs and 33 RBI . That included a .192 batting average before the All-Star break , which almost resulted in a trip back to Class AAA Charlotte . <p> Two things saved him : his defense in center field and his unwavering confidence . <p> Both will be tested this spring , as the Sox reconvene this week in Tucson , Ariz. , for the 2007 season . <p> Not only did the Sox put pressure on Anderson by signing veteran outfielder Darin Erstad , who can play left and center fields , but youngsters Ryan Sweeney and Jerry Owens have closed the gap on possibly overtaking Anderson as a starter . <p> So how is the laid-back Anderson preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a lot of confidence in my defense , " Anderson said . " I think I 'm one of the top defensive outfielders in baseball , and I think you have to think that way . I think my defense can pick me up even when I 'm struggling at the plate . I have a year under my belt , another year of maturity , and I think that I can take that year with me and it can carry over to a positive . " While Anderson is not the marquee player on the South Side by any means , that does n't mean all eyes wo n't be on him when position players report Feb. 21 . The Sox are well-versed in what Paul Konerko , Jim Thome and Jermaine Dye bring to the table . <p> It 's Anderson who tops a list of five players who will draw a lot of attention and make a difference in the Sox reaching the postseason or watching it at home again . <p> 1 . OF Brian Anderson Simply put , his play in the spring will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , but the groin injury to left fielder Scott Podsednik opened up a huge hole and even more questions . <p> The Sox would love for Anderson to show that last season can be written off as rookie growing pains and for him to grab the job in center . <p> That would allow Erstad to start in left while youngsters Sweeney and Owens get one more year in the minors . When Podsednik comes back , the Sox can decide what to do with Erstad . <p> If Anderson struggles during spring training , then all bets are off . Sweeney and Owens might get a serious look , and Erstad might move to center . As far as Anderson , his future would be in doubt with two younger players jumping him . <p> 2 . RHP Gavin Floyd Seeing time as a starter and reliever last season with the Philadelphia Phillies , the young right-hander did n't really shine until the fall . <p> " Electric " was how general manager Ken Williams described Floyd 's stuff in the Arizona Fall League , which played a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter meetings . <p> But the public will make the comparisons to what Garcia did for the Sox in his 21/2 seasons with the team , and even Floyd knows that 's unavoidable . <p> " I 'm who I am , " Floyd said . " I 'm going to continue to be who I am . I do n't feel like I have to fill any shoes . " Not necessarily true . Floyd not only has to show he can be a starter , but he also has to beat out highly touted prospect John Danks and knuckleballer Charlie Haeger . <p> With starter Mark Buehrle likely dashing for free agency after the season and the contracts of Jose Contreras , Jon Garland and Javier Vazquez moving another year closer to coming to an end , the Sox need this new wave of pitchers to start showing themselves . <p> Floyd is atop that wave . <p> 3 . LF Scott Podsednik All eyes will be on Podsednik 's groin -- literally . At the same time , the Sox are prepared to move on without him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to platoon Erstad and Pablo Ozuna in the leadoff spot as Podsednik continues to recover from his groin surgery in late January . <p> If he can start baseball activity by the end of camp , then he will be left back for extended spring training before rejoining the team . <p> But even if he does return fully recovered , he still might find himself in a platoon situation with Erstad and Ozuna . <p> 4 . RHP David Aardsma According to manager Ozzie Guillen , the biggest problem facing his team last season was middle relief . Far too often , he watched his relievers struggle to get the ball from the starter to the back end of the bullpen . <p> Enter Aardsma . <p> The hard-throwing right-hander is penciled in to do what Cliff Politte did for the Sox during their 2005 championship run . If he can do that , it will go a long way in setting up the rest of the bullpen and truly making it a team strength . <p> 5 . SS Juan Uribe The Sox would love nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but considering his legal problems in the Dominican Republic this offseason , the hope is that he just shows up . <p> The Sox ' defense showed some holes up the middle last season , and Guillen called Uribe 's range into question . <p> Even if he is in shape and ready to go , Uribe likely will miss time this spring because of an alleged offseason shooting incident . <p> In other words , reserve Alex Cintron had better be ready to go . <p> jcowley@suntimes.com <p> - - - <p> THE PROJECTIONS <p> With 2006 statistics <p> Opening Day lineup <p> 1 .

##3065257 <p> We all know what a healthy Derrek Lee can do in the middle of the Cubs ' lineup . Ace pitcher Carlos Zambrano has n't visited the disabled list since 2002 . Alfonso <p> Soriano testing the waters in center field will be firmly on the Arizona radar -- and one of the dominant stories of camp . <p> But when Cubs pitchers and catchers report Wednesday to Mesa , Ariz. , several other players will spend the next six weeks helping to shape a new era for the Cubs . <p> Here 's a closer look at five other players worth watching during spring training : <p> 1 . IF/OF Mark DeRosa <p> Getting the chance to play second base every day was one of the key reasons DeRosa said he signed with the Cubs . Getting a three-year , $13 million contract -- big money for a player who spent most of his career coming off the bench -- probably was the deciding factor . <p> DeRosa , who turns 32 on Feb. 26 , enters camp as the Cubs ' No. 1 second baseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- 60 games -- playing right field for the Texas Rangers . That 's more than twice as many games as he played at second base ( 26 ) . DeRosa , who also can play shortstop and third base , is the wildest of wild cards for the Cubs . <p> With Ryan Theriot projected as the future second baseman , a strong spring by the youngster might push DeRosa back into a world of bouncing around . And this might be a nice situation for the Cubs . DeRosa hit .342 against left-handers last season and would be a perfect platoon partner for right fielder Jacque Jones , who is a below-average hitter ( .234 last season ) against lefties . <p> When the Cubs signed DeRosa in November , general manager Jim Hendry said : " He does give manager Lou Piniella a lot of options . But we brought him in to play second base . " <p> Let 's see if DeRosa playing second base makes the most sense for the Cubs by the end of camp . <p> 2 . SS Cesar Izturis <p> Playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that started Aug. 1 -- when the team still was working its way down toward last place -- it 's easy to forget that Izturis was acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers to be the shortstop of the future . <p> Shortly after his arrival in Chicago last summer , Izturis showed he had what it took to be a Cub in 2006 , landing on the disabled list because of a strained right hamstring . <p> Izturis , who turned 27 on Saturday , enters camp 17 months removed from reconstructive surgery on his right elbow . Pitchers usually need two years to bounce back from Tommy John surgery , but the recovery period is shorter for position players . <p> Izturis ' arm is expected to be fine , but the switch hitter has been slowed by back and hamstring problems in recent years . Izturis was acquired for his defense , but if he continues to break down , the Cubs might have to take a longer-than-expected look at Ronny <p> Cedeno , who vowed after the Caribbean World Series that he would make a big splash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Jacque Jones stays off the trade block during camp and veteran Cliff Floyd lives up to his promise to avoid a platoon situation , Murton might be the odd man out in the Cubs ' outfield . <p> The contact hitter is prized by Hendry , but his lack of pop -- 13 home runs -- and so-so defense might knock him out of Piniella 's lineup . <p> Murton , 25 , has plate discipline that impresses scouts , and his .297 batting average was tops among Cubs with at least 400 at-bats last season . <p> His best work came during the last two months of the season , when he showed a surprising power surge . Nine of Murton 's 13 homers came in August and September . This from a player who went through a stretch of 123 at-bats -- a dry spell that included all of June and July -- with no homers . After hitting .278 with 27 RBI and a .344 on-base percentage in 248 first-half at-bats , Murton hit .319 with 35 RBI and a .390 on-base percentage in 207 at-bats after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Murton 's second half was a mirage when the pressure was off or the look of a young player maturing . <p> 4 . RHP Wade Miller Most observers are expecting Mark Prior -- Wade Miller 's primary rival for the fifth spot in the rotation -- to come up lame during camp . Even if Prior stays healthy , Miller is expected to make things interesting . <p> Hendry has been betting for more than a year that Miller , a 30-year-old right-hander , can return to his 2001 form -- when he won 16 games for the Houston Astros -- once he recovered from surgery in October 2005 to repair a torn labrum . Miller 's one-year , $1.5 million contract allows for an additional $3.75 million in <p> incentives if he can secure a spot in the rotation and stay healthy . <p> Miller 's success early in his career was boosted by a fastball that could reach the mid-90s . He operated mostly around 88 mph during his late-season stint with the Cubs in 2006 and must learn how to be a more complete pitcher this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cotts was acquired from the White Sox for right-hander David Aardsma in November , the left-hander was mentioned as a candidate for the Cubs ' rotation . <p> That talk raised eyebrows , considering Cotts was a key part of the Sox ' bullpen during their World Series championship in 2005 , when he went 4-0 with a 1.94 ERA . Cotts slipped last season , going 1-2 with a 5.17 ERA amid talk he had lost confidence in the late- inning role . <p> With Scott Eyre filling the main duties as the left-handed setup man and Will Ohman another trusted lefty reliever , Cotts , 26 , likely will be groomed for the all-important swing role that had been occupied by veteran Glendon Rusch , who went 18-18 with a 4.69 ERA during his three-year stint with the Cubs . In 44 starts , Rusch went 14-15 with a 4.62 ERA -- not bad for a fill-in . <p> Cotts had been eyed as a future starter for the Sox until their rotation became overloaded . He will get the innings during camp to prove his worth outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Matt Murton ; Photo : Wade Miller ; Photo : Neal Cotts ; Photo : Chris Gardner , Associated Press ; Mark DeRosa enters camp as the Cubs ' starting second baseman , but he might be more valuable in a platoon with right fielder Jacque Jones . ; 
##3065258 <p> In a classroom at Columbia College , Marcos " Professor Kosine " Palacios cues up rapper Jay-Z 's " Minority Report , " a song about Hurricane Ka-trina . <p> Sounds of a rainstorm , helicopters and a mournful concertina slam the soundproofed walls . The beat begins , slow like a dirge , and vibrates the desktops . <p> ' LISTEN TO MORE PAVAROTTI ' <p> Palacios , 24 , dressed in jeans and a white sweatshirt , cuts the song after the introduction and starts quizzing his class . " What did you hear ? " <p> " Helicopters , " a student in a backward , green cap volunteers . " TV reporters , " says another . <p> " OK , great , " says Palacios . But he points out they also heard the start of a Luciano Pavarotti recording . <p> " Now if you 're really smart , go listen to more Pavarotti , " Palacios advises . " You can figure out what other hot intros you can use for your music . " Then he set the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first verse . <p> ' THE REALITY IS , IT 'S POSSIBLE ' <p> A recent Columbia graduate and music producer , Palacios is in his second semester of teaching Producing Recorded Music : Hip-Hop Beat Making in Columbia 's Arts , Entertainment and Media Management department . The class , designed by Palacios , focuses both on the process of producing hip-hop music and the business of being a producer -- how to develop the skills and contacts to make a living . <p> " The reality is , it 's possible , " said Palacios , partner in a production business called Da Internz . " I 'm living it right now . It 's a dream come true . But it 's work . " <p> Palacios wants to show his students what 's in different types of hip-hop music , how to reproduce it and how to build on what 's out there to make new sounds . Palacios calls the process of innovation " putting cheese on it . " <p> " Once you understand those elements and can recreate them , it opens up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Palacios said . He recently produced a recording in Los Angeles for a skateboard group , The Boardbangers for the Jaded Entertainment label . <p> " It 's like cooking -- what makes it a Louisiana gumbo instead of chicken soup ? Then you can go off and make a chicken-noodle gumbo -- a sound that 's never been created before , " he said . <p> For Palacios ' class , the students come up with producer names ; for example , Spanish class students take on Spanish names . One aspiring producer is " Omega . " Another is " Freebase . " <p> Homework includes analyzing songs , bit by bit . The mid-term requires students to reproduce a recording . The final is an original song . The class includes guest speakers from the business who talk about marketing , dealing with singers and other tricks of the trade . <p> A PROMISE TO HIS MOM <p> Palacios grew up in the Broadview/Maywood area with his mother , Pearl C. Johnson , a nurse at Loyola University Health Center . Johnson sent him to Catholic schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reliance . Her main goal was for him to finish college . <p> " She was a super-mom , a multidimensional mom , " said Palacios , who bears the tattoo " Mama 's Boy " on his right arm . " She was amazing . " <p> Palacios started playing piano at 6 and later studied saxophone and drums . In 2001 , he won a saxophone scholarship to Florida A &M; University and played in the " Marching 100 . " Palacios first made money as a music producer by 18 , but his mother insisted he needed a backup plan , so he majored in music education . <p> Johnson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2001 , and Palacios left college to care for her . While she lay dying , Palacios read aloud his fall schedule at Columbia . <p> " I said ' I know you 're not going to be here , but I promise I 'll finish school for you , ' " he said . " I did n't want to -- I was already making money doing music . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> Palacios ' mother died Sept. 10 , 2003 , and he graduated from Columbia with a music business degree on Mother 's Day in 2006 . <p> Palacios proposed the hip-hop class to Kimo Williams , music business coordinator at Columbia and Palacios ' former teacher . Palacios said he wanted to help others earn money doing what they love . <p> " I want to help them cultivate and develop their music skills and learn some of the business , " he said . He 's not teaching theory , but he wants his students to know enough about the fundamentals to be able to communicate with artists and others in the business . " The rest is on them to create their own destiny . " <p> Back in class , a student grumbles about the Jay-Z song . He does n't feel Jay-Z -- how could he write about him for homework ?

##3065259 <p> MISSING SHOT <p> There are more downsides to the Stroger clan clogging the Cook County payroll than just their fat paychecks . <p> There is also the bother of dealing with their swelled egos , as the overworked employees at 26th and California discovered last week when Ann Collins , an assistant public defender , tried to find out who had locked herself in the seventh-floor bathroom to smoke . <p> " I knocked on the door . I waited for the person to come out , " said Collins . " There was smoke in there . " <p> When the puffer emerged -- after 20 minutes -- it was Yonnie Lynn Clark , Todd Stroger 's sister . <p> " She started yelling at me , ' I know what this is about ! ' " said Collins . " And I said , ' You tell me what this is about , other than you smoking in the bathroom . ' " <p> Smoking is banned in public buildings in Cook County . Even if you 're related to Todd Stroger . <p> FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Jews confess them to psychiatrists -- a better deal for the Catholics , if you ask me , considering what 50 minutes with a therapist will set you back nowadays . <p> Matters of economy aside , I 've always been intrigued with confession -- so spiritual , so calm and redemptive . Visiting churches with friends , I 'm always tempted to slip into line and see what confession 's like , though I suppose it would be quite a burden to spring upon the poor priest hearing it : " Bless me father , for I have sinned -- well , I 'm a Jew , first of all , which means I 've never believed in Jesus or practiced the sacraments , prior to this , I mean . . . . " <p> Which is my awkward attempt to explain why I 'm printing this letter from Deborah Beasley , who assures me that neither she nor her seven siblings will mind seeing it in the paper . <p> Hi Neil , <p> I read your column today about **28;3422;TOOLONG and it brought back a memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how meddlesome ministers in the bedroom have always been with us . <p> Forty some years ago , my father and I went to confession at our Catholic church to fulfill our Easter duty . . . . There were many people waiting to make their confession so I sat in a pew making my examination of conscience before confession and waiting for the line to get shorter so I could see a priest I had great affection for , Father Bruno . <p> Dad , however , was impatient and jumped into a short line where a visiting priest was dealing with the overflow crowds and it was quickly his turn . Dad was in the confessional for only a minute or so when the air in that holy place was shattered by his enraged bellowing , the gist of which was , " What do you MEAN , do I use BIRTH CONTROL ? I have eight kids , you <p> F - - - ING MORON ! " <p> Everyone looked to the confessional in open-mouthed , gawping horror and my father , purple-faced and furious , burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're leaving .

Laine was born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio in Chicago 's Little Italy and attended Lane Tech High School . When he decided to take a stage name , he decided to honor his old school , adding an " i " for a distinctive twist . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now . He was old in 1972 when I knew him , as my seventh-grade English teacher . <p> Though " old " might have meant 45 to me then , so perhaps he is alive and in retirement , in a comfortable chair somewhere , reading the books he loved . I sure hope so . <p> Of course , being a teacher means you never truly die . I was reminded of this last week , when I began reading Beowulf to the older boy -- astounding , I know . <p> I read the first few words in the original Old English , to give him a flavor of the thing . <p> " Hw3/4t ! We Gardena in geardagum . . . . " I began , then paused . <p> " You know , " I said . " They translate ' Hw3/4t ' here as " Listen ! ' but it really means , ' What ! ' Linguists believe that ' what ' is an onomatopoeia -- a word taken from a sound . That before there was language , and early humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . . . . " <p> Here I stuck out my right hand , palm open and up , and smacked my open left palm down on it , making a noise that indeed sounded very much like " What ! " <p> I knew this -- in fact , was quoting pretty much word for word -- because Mr. Garman told me so in his classroom in 1972 . I 'm passing it along to you , even at the risk of revealing my family 's appallingly pointy-headed habits , as a reminder to teachers everywhere . The kids might mouth off -- I did . They might seem like they 're not paying attention -- I sure did . But they are paying attention -- if you 're any good . And they remember , and pass what you teach them on to others , and sometimes even thank you . Thanks , Mr. Garman . <p> TODAY 'S CHUCKLE <p> Freud Joke Week concludes with a joke that , though dusty , might ring true to anyone who has ever tried to command the attention of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroness in her confinement , pronounces that the moment has not yet come , and suggests to the Baron that in the meantime they should have a game of cards in the next room . <p> After a while a cry of pain from the Baroness strikes the ears of the two men : " Ah , mon dieu , que je souffre ! " <p> Her husband springs up , but the doctor signals him to sit down : " It 's nothing . Let 's go on with the game ! " A little later , again sounds from the pregnant woman : " Mein Gott , Mein Gott , what terrible pains ! " <p> " Are n't you going in , Herr Doctor ? " asks the Baron . " <p> " No , no . It 's not time yet . " <p> At last , from next door comes an unmistakable cry of " Waaaa , waaaaa ! " <p> The doctor throws down his cards and exclaims : " NOW it 's time !
