" Nana asks in her unique accent , the voice I love to hear . " Where do you want to go , Nana ? " I ask back . " How about I surprise you ! " She pulls into the parking lot of a Walgreens and we walk in . It 's November , and the warmth of the store overwhelms your body and creates the illusion that you 're still cold . The place seems so beautiful ! Almost surely the most beautiful thing I had ever seen . I was squealing with delight even before I heard Nana say , " Pick anything you like , Pumpkin Spice ! " I began running up and down the aisles looking for the perfect thing - and I stop . A small plastic doll is staring at me with bright emerald eyes . I grin and run with it to Nana . " This is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down with excitement . " She 's beautiful , Pumpkin Spice , " she replies , her eyes gleaming . I can tell she likes the doll as much as I do . But then I see the price tag for the doll and blurt out , " But it 's fifteen dollars ! " That may not seem like much to you , but it was a lot to me . I was only five and had roughly , well , zero dollars in my savings . I did not know how anyone could afford that doll . " Will you remember me forever and always ? " she asks . " Oh , yes , Nana . Yes ! Yes ! " It was a fact I was sure of . Every last bit of it . " Then she 's yours ! " Nana smiled as she said this , but I felt like frowning . I am not quite sure why I felt this way ; I just did . While we drive home after our midnight run , we listen to Christmas songs and Nana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's looking at my doll . " What will you name her , Pumpkin Spice ? " " Let 's wait and see , " I reply . I imagine that my doll is a real person , and naturally , I 'd have to get to know her to give her a name . We drove on in that way for quite some time . Nana was looking at me and I was looking out the window , enjoying the scenery . She must n't have been paying attention to the road because the next thing I knew , another car was barreling towards the side of our car . " Nana , watch out ! " I screeched at the top of my lungs . I kept on yelling for her to stop or speed up , and she did . We stopped - but I knew that it was n't with the brakes . We had been hit . I woke up in the hospital to see my mother gazing at me with a worried expression . I discovered that I had some cuts and bruises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I thought Nana probably put it there , but she was n't in the room . " Where 's Nana ? " I asked my mother . She did n't answer . " Is she dead ? " I asked in a frightened tone . My mother said nothing . " It 's OK , you can tell me , " I said , and began to cry . " Yes , " my mother said hoarsely , speaking so softly it was almost a whisper . I felt a torrent of tears begin , running down my cheeks and onto my clothes . I thought of the last thing Nana had said to me , " What will you name her ? " I wish I had responded then . Names had been important to her ; she had always named things , everything . And now I would find the perfect name . For Nana . More black bands for mourning were sold that week than I had ever seen before . Nana had been like a hero to everyone she had met , from the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends at the park that has been faced with closure until she held a fundraiser . And me . I dressed for the funeral carefully in the clothes my mother had picked - a black blouse , black corduroy pants , soft black cardigan , and shiny black Mary Janes that showed my reflection . I did not feel a thing . The shirt itched and the shoes were tight , but I felt none of it . I only felt numbness in my arms and legs . This numbness was like Nana 's touch , and right now it was something I was not ready to let go of . I wanted to keep her as close to me as I could . Mom came to tell me it was time to go . We drove to the cemetery , and we all stooped out of the car together , bowing our heads , Mom , my doll , and I. My mom was holding my hand tight , squeezing tighter when she tried not to cry . I lifted my head , curious to see what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I needed to know . I needed to know what happened to Nana , and where she was . I wanted to see her one last time before she was buried . My eyes saw something in the distance that looked like a nose sticking out from a big wooden box . I needed to figure out what it was . My hand pulled away from Mom 's and I ran over to that box without looking back ; I just needed to know . My eyes were surprised when I looked into the box : There was Nana . Her cheeks were flushed and her skin paler than the whitest white . She looked sick and sad , but peaceful . I was overwhelmed ; so happy to see Nana , but scared to see her there , like that . Impulsively , I jumped into the casket with her , hugging her and kissing her goodbye . I felt everything now , the cold of November , the silk lining of Nana 's casket , and most of all , a cemetery filled with sorrow . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wounded body . My arms were wrapped around her tightly , as if to keep her from going on to the next life , hoping I could pull her back . But even when I realized I could n't , I still laid there , tears overflowing , and I think my doll cried , too . I stayed there until my mom was finally able to get through the crowd of people around me . She picked me up and took me to a seat . It was in the front row , so I could still see Nana . I cried through the whole service and I kept my eye on Nana . They called up people to pay their respects to Nana , but my mom would n't let me . She told the woman next to me to watch me while she went up . She cried too , she cried over Nana , so I could n't see why I was n't allowed . When she came back , I asked if she could put my doll into the casket with Nana . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nana 's heart . She was safe now . We drove home and it was quiet ; there was no talking or music in the car . It was not until we were almost home that my mother even looked at me . " Why did you want me to put your doll into the box with Nana ? " she asked . " Because , Mom , the doll 's name was Nana . She was Nana 's soul , and had to be returned to her body , or she would not have been happy . " I had thought this out very carefully , and to me it seemed like a reasonable explanation . " Oh , " my mom said . " Oh , " and that was all . They were safe now . Both of them . 
##4085453 It 's September 12 , my first class with second-year strings at an elementary school named Spurges . When I walk into the sixth-grade classroom , one of many portable rooms lined up in facing rows , something feels very wrong . The room has no lights on - it seems cave-like . Stacks of paper , books , and school materials are everywhere . The overhead projector looks like a sorry camel , with a hump of workbooks , texts , and marker pens precariously balanced on its plastic hide . There are no cheery bulletin boards welcoming students back to school or promoting past presidents . No fattened fish in the " science corner " or computer stations with the newest Apple software . It 's as though I 've walked into a stale classroom of the ' 50s , ' 60s , and ' 70s combined , and any rightminded custodian decided long ago it just was n't worth it . Yet , the teacher is here and having an intense one-way conversation with a petite student . " Not at lunch , or recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he is saying , just inches from the student 's face . The girl walks away and glances back at him with a look that comes with practiced malice - not so overt that it invites further confrontation , yet leaving no doubt of her feelings . I introduce myself to the teacher . " Maynard Sully , " he says , introducing himself , and in the same breath he addresses the students : " Did I give you permission to go to your lessons yet ? " A pause ensues . " Okay , band students , you may leave . Non-band , you may leave . Orchestra students from Mrs. Bracken , you may come in . " I watch the girl who has been the object of Mr. Sully 's attention . She 's standing next to a blond girl who is a foot taller , with bangs that completely cover one eye . They look at me , giggle with some unspoken shared humor , and each pick up a violin . This is among my first days of teaching in a challenging yearlong personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university level for the last 15 years , how much I 'd lost of what it is to be a public-school teacher . Does staleness set in after a professor has been out of the field for so long ? How could I continue to help young teachers when I 'd been absent from their ranks ? Although I had n't been completely isolated from the K-1 2 profession - supervising student teachers , conducting youth orchestras , and serving as a clinician for schools - so much seemed to have changed : computer technology , cell phones , texting , the reach of the Internet , standardized testing . What had n't changed ? Even under constant budget duress , parents and school districts still want music for their children and for the arts to play a role in public education . To reacquaint myself , I had decided to take a year 's leave from my job at Texas Tech University and accepted a string/orchestra teaching position in a school district in California , the state of historic educational reform and taxpayer revolt . So I take an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County . Vacaville is a medium-sized city with a median family income near the average for the state ; I commute from another mid-sized city 26 miles away . I teach in eight schools : one middle school , one high school , and six elementary schools , traveling to five of them each day . In the majority of the elementary schools , I am in another teacher 's classroom , giving lessons to between eight and 26 students . The year before my arrival , the students ' teacher had left over Christmas break and the district had filled the remainder of the year with substitute teachers . Every afternoon , during my commute home , I record what I think is important about the day 's events . After a year , my journal is filled with accounts of struggles , accomplishments , my own discoveries , and of children learning to play their instruments . September 14 At Peachtree Elementary school , my class consists of eight beginning cellists . This is different than some of my other elementary schools , where I have large heterogeneous string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warrant their own class . I do n't think I could order up a more excited and interested ensemble of young cello players . As they arrive , a few students have already named their cellos . Clarence , a round-faced boy , introduces his cello to everyone : " This is Murphy , " he says . The pony-tailed and trendily dressed Annabeth chimes in , " Hello , this is Caroline . " And so it goes . We sit in a semi-circle in a carpeted hallway ( our temporary classroom ) , and learn the parts of the cello , how to unpack them , and , of course , that the cello is a very fragile thing . " Imagine your cello as a new member of your family , " I tell the beginners . " You have a new brother or sister , and they depend on you to take care of them . You would n't leave your little brother in a hot car when you get groceries , would you ? " They shake their heads slowly , seriously . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to turn any pegs yet . See the pegs ? " They share comical glances . " You would n't put them in the middle of the hallway , where the rest of the family might trip over them ? " They waggle their heads again , although Clarence looks pensively at the ceiling , seeming to weigh this notion with a particular sibling in mind . Eagerly , they sit on the edges of their chairs with tall , noble postures as I fit a cello to each student . September 29 At Spurges Elementary , I find Mr. Sully standing outside his door , slapping a pair of yardsticks into the palm of his hand . Last week , it was a baseball bat . I have n't seen him use them in any other way . The point must be the threat . Today , again , the lights are off . After Mr. Sully leaves , I turn them on , and get looks from students as though I might be headed for in-school suspension . Mr. Sully comes back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up at the lights , then at me , and sits at his desk , looking off into space , past dozens of papers at geometric angles and at least three inches deep . Our lesson ends and other students return to the room . Mr. Sully keeps staring , saying nothing . October 5 At Dunagan Elementary , Kendra ( my student teacher ) and I both think we have " arrived " at teaching an effective class . The 16 students are in their places , moving from rest position to playing position in almost quasi-military style . The beginners play the pieces and exercises that we ask . They 're having fun and smiling , excited for the next thing . It 's going splendidly . I have the students get their bows to learn how to tighten the horsehair and apply rosin . Four or five of them do n't have any rosin bricks in their cases , so we are sharing rosin . Owen is sharing his with Katrina , who has none in her case . Katrina is a bright girl who has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Owen 's rosin is a little cracked and , according to Katrina , it cut her horse hairs and tore three of them off her bow . Not only that , she explains , but " a piece of his rosin is in my horsehair ! " She 's quite distressed about this . Meanwhile , Owen is upset that his rosin is disintegrating before his eyes . This is rosin he 's never used before , and here it is decomposing into Katrina 's horsehair ( of course , the rosin , with its faded trademark on the box , has probably been in this school-owned instrument case for a decade ) . While the rosin wars are breaking out between Katrina and Owen , Timothy , a fidgety ten-year-old violinist , has his cell phone go off in his front pocket as I 'm getting his first bow hold placed correctly . Timothy 's demeanor changes immediately to a four-footer in a business suit . " Just a second , " he says , " that 's my dad . " For a moment , I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his cell phone is ringing , I 'll have to wait a moment , " before I come to my senses and realize this is a fifth grader answering his cell phone in the heart of our lesson . As I 'm about to react , a first-grade girl ( sister of one of our string players ) shows up early to walk home with her brother . She passes the time by sticking her tongue out at Owen , he of the crumbling rosin . Attention wanes on my attempt to show Timothy and everyone else how to hold their bows . The bell rings , and we never get to make our first bowed sounds on the instrument . After I dismiss the class , I 'm stooped over the kindergarten sink washing the remains of Owen 's rosin off my hands . Behind me , I hear Katrina say meekly , " Dr. Wood ? " I turn around . She has her instrument beautifully tucked in rest position and gives me a low , formal bow . October 31 At Dunagan Elementary , Rebecca is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she likes the cello a lot . Timothy , although he 's a handful , is well-coordinated , and has picture-perfect posture and positions . Suri says she 's practicing every day , and it shows : beautiful curved fingers and a nice bow hold . Owen continues to take up about a third of my time . " My bow does n't work . . . . Why is the horsehair dark down here . . . ? Can I sit down . . . ? My cousin has three dogs . . . . What would happen if I put guitar strings on my violin . . . ? " If I turn to the left , or to the right , Owen is inches from my face . Today , I 'm at the board , drawing bow lengths with chalk . Owen tucks under my raised arm and puts his face between me and the board . " Dr. Wood , another hair came off my bow ! " If I were in a swiveling tank turret , Owen would manage , always , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Owen , you must stay in your playing spot , and raise your hand when you wish to speak . " It 's as though I 've just squeezed all the life out of him . But seconds later , like a newly hydrated sponge , he 's back . " Dr. Wood , " he says enthusiastically , " when you said we would play in a circle , I was thinking that , too ! " November 14 The beginning students at Sellen Elementary are learning the " Spider Crawl . " This is a game in which the bow is held vertically , and students creep up the stick of the bow with their right hand , from frog to tip and back again , ending with their " perfect " bow hold . I tell them that the record time of all the beginners I 've ever taught is 16 seconds . In a moment of unconsidered philanthropy , I say , " Sixteen seconds is very fast . So , I 'll tell you what , any student who can do the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 20 seconds will get a Frosty from Wendy 's . " This prospect electrifies the room . Philip , the only boy in this class of 11 violinists , says , " That 'll be easy . " He brings his hand very close to his eyes and , as if proximity equals speed , starts practicing . Amelia , a girl who had broken a string the first week of class , holds her threefourths-sized bow up against Genevieve 's half-sized bow . " That 's not fair ! " she complains . Soon many students are practicing hard , but instead of " crawling " up and down the bow , they 're letting gravity bring the bow from frog to tip then shuttling back down . I need to set further ground rules . Francis puts both bow and instrument down , raising her hand in that **43;554;TOOLONG fashion . " Yes , Francis ? " " Can it be either vanilla or chocolate ? I 'm allergic to chocolate . " " Yes , Francis , either one . " Almost immediately , I 'm feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students will be able to perform this game in under 20 seconds . I do n't like classroom games in which there are winners and losers . I 'm teaching music , and believe fervently in the Suzuki philosophy of " Every child can . " Why am I fostering such competition ? November 20 Three lessons later , I have purchased my 11th Frosty : eight chocolates , three vanillas . Total cost : $21.53 . December 13 At Garden Middle School , we 're doing vibrato exercises each day . This morning , I notice that Elizabeth looks like she 's really getting it : the rotation of her wrist is very nice , with the first knuckle of her index finger millimeters away from the fingerboard and a neutral , relaxed wrist . " Elizabeth , " I say , " would you show everyone what you 're doing with vibrato ? " She plays an FlI on the D string . At first , the tone is straight , with a timbre that 's a combination of alto recorder and an adolescent soprano , humming . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second finger and back , the knuckle just below the nail relaxing so that more of the tip of her finger touches the string . A gorgeous , warm sound blossoms at seven to eight oscillations per second . When she finishes , the violin 's tone suspends for a moment as the other students realize Elizabeth has broken some musical " sound barrier . " The orchestra spontaneously claps their hands and stomps their feet . I lower my voice to almost a whisper . " What you just heard , " I say . " What she 's able to do , is something I want all of you to be able to do before the end of the year . That 's why we 're practicing it each day . When you 're able to accomplish vibrato , it will be the closest thing to magic you 'll experience on your instrument . Your sound will change , just like you heard Elizabeth 's , into something rich and deep . " It 's quiet in the room . No middleschool jokes are being cracked . The students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noiselessly rolling their wrists and arms forward and back , imagining the magic . December 22 It 's Friday , the last day before the holiday break . At Peachtree Elementary , Clarence - one of my cello beginners - comes up to me at the start of class and gives me a small cake . At first glance , it looks like a Little Debbie Cake with chocolate icing . " Thank you very much , Clarence , " I say . " I 'm sure this will come in handy on my ride home . Now , would you get your cello out ? " We have our lesson , but all the while Clarence keeps looking at me and smiling a larger-than-usual smile . When we finish , and I wish all the cello players happy holidays , Clarence runs up to me , ready to burst . " Dr. Wood , are you going to eat it now ? " " Clarence , as I said , I think I might wait and . . . " Clarence jumps in : " Dr. Wood , my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cool molds . Then we baked them , and dipped them in this melted chocolate from bars , you know , of chocolate , and then I got to put sprinkles on them in these cool designs . " Clarence 's face is a picture of pride . I look down at the cake again , and realize it is n't your 70 percent chemical additive store-bought cake . The edges of the frosting have started to melt . I sit down on one of the small elementary chairs , across from Clarence . The rest of the students have left . " Hmm , " I say , " let 's take a closer look . " Sprinkled on top of the chocolate in pinks and blues is the outline of a cello , a faint fingerprint near the scroll . " You like chocolate , do n't you , Clarence ? " He presses his lips together , and nods . I break a piece off , and we sit in the quiet library , and steal a few minutes to share a homemade cake and talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Final Report What have I discovered during my time on the frontlines ? That successful teaching and learning in public schools is not about any one thing , it 's about many things . Teacher personality , style , and expertise , school facilities , individual school cultures , family influence , administrative support , curricular schedule , and budget all play critical roles . But good learning and teaching are dependent upon multiple factors and , even within a single district , where one might assume a level playing field for children , some schools succeed and some do not . Why ? Because one or more of those crucial ingrethents is missing or damaged . I also learned a hard personal lesson : even with a great deal of experience , I am still a first-year teacher in a challenging setting . During my year back in the classroom , I would succeed , and 1 would fail . Yet those experiences and feelings , often separated by just a short commute between schools , reaffirm my belief that teaching in the arts is difficult , frustrating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person can make with his or her life .

##4085454 PROLOGUE Narrator A : The Civil War , the bloodiest conflict in American history , began 150 years ago this spring . Although the war had several contributing causes , slavery was at the root of them all . Narrator B : When Abraham Lincoln was elected President in November I860 , the U.S. had 33 states . Of these , 15 allowed slavery , and 18 did not . Since the birth of the nation , Americans had disagreed about slavery- not only about its morality , but also whether it should be allowed in new states joining the Union . Narrator C : The month after Lincoln- an opponent of slavery from Illinois- was elected , South Carolina seceded from the Union . In January 1861 , five other slave states did the same . SCENE 1 Narrator D : In early February 1861 , in a general store in Charleston , South Carolina . . . Ella Rae Stone : So , folks , what do you think of our new country ? Jabez Ennis : What do you mean ? Stone : Have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , Alabama , Georgia , and Louisiana have been meeting in Montgomery , Alabama . Ennis : What of it ? Stone : They voted to establish a new country- the Confederate States of America ! Texas just joined . Ennis : I suppose it 's a good idea . Cal Wiggins : You " suppose " ? You were mighty proud in December , when South Carolina seceded ! Ennis : Yes , because we wanted to remind the North what the Constitution says : The powers not given to the federal government belong to the states . Each state should set its own laws on slavery ! Stone : Well , the North did n't listen . Ennis : Do you think this will mean war ? Most of us in the South do n't even own slaves . Why should we risk our necks to fight the North ? Stone : Because our way of life is at stake ! Their economy is based on factories and small farms . They do n't need slaves . In the South , we rely on big plantations that grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave labor , the plantation system would collapse . Without the plantations , our economy would wither . Who could afford to shop in your store then ? Ennis : Gosh , I 'd be ruined ! SCENE 2 Narrator E : On February 11 , the Lincoln victory train leaves Springfield , Illinois , carrying the President-elect to his inauguration in Washington , D. C , on March 4 . Stopping in Albany , New York , Lincoln is met by the Governor and a small crowd of reporters . First reporter : Jefferson Davis has just been sworn in as President of the Confederate States of America ! Edwin D. Morgan : Mr. Lincoln is aware of that . Second reporter : What does he intend to do about it ? Morgan : Gentlemen , please ! Allow Mr. Lincoln to be inaugurated before you demand answers to such questions . First reporter : But this is a national crisis ! What if other states decide to secede ? Second reporter : Mr. Lincoln ! Does this mean war ? Abraham Lincoln : For now , James Buchanan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak as well as I am able- for the good of both the North and the South . In the meantime , if we have patience , if we restrain ourselves not to run off in passion , I believe that the Almighty , through this great and intelligent people , will bring us through all our difficulties . SCENE 3 Narrator A : On March 6&gt; two days after taking the oath of office , Lincoln receives a dispatch from Major Robert Anderson , commander at Fort Sumter , a military base in Charleston 's harbor . Lincoln : The major reports that his food supplies are running low . He can hold out 40 more days at most . Winfield Scott : I would advise you to abandon Fort Sumter , Mr. President . It would take a large fleet and at least 25,000 troops to resupply it . Stephen A. Douglas : But if the South 's rebellion is allowed to go on , it could turn into full-scale war . Lincoln : I do n't want war . But the Union must be preserved at all costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SCENE 4 Narrator B : At 4:30 a.m. on April 12 , Confederate troops begin firing on Fort Sumter . Inside the fort . . . Robert Anderson : Let 's proceed with caution , men . Narratore C : Anderson 's troops fire back but inflict little damage on the rebels . John Carmody : We must fire our cannons- or we 'll be wiped out ! Miles Tyler : But they 're on the other side of the fort , where it 's undefended . It 's too dangerous . Carmody : It 's our only chancel Narrator D : Carmody dashes to the cannons and , single-handedly , fires them one by one . But without help , he ca n't reload . Then . . . Tyler : Look over there ! The relief ships President Lincoln sent are arriving ! We 're saved ! Carmody : Hallelujah ! Narrator E : But a hail of bullets and cannonballs wo n't let the ships dock . Worse , Confederate cannonballs set the fort on fire . On April 14 , Major Anderson surrenders . The Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South 's victory at Fort Sumter prompts four more states to join the Confederacy . Outraged Northerners demand that the Union Army strike back hard and fast . Americans on both sides expect a short war . Then comes the First Battle of Bull Run in Virginia , on July 21 . The next day , in Washington , D. C. . . . Sarah Timlin : Mr. Russell ! What 's your hurry ? William Howard Russell : I 've got an article to write ! Yesterday , hordes of people went to Manassas Junction in Virginia to watch the battle . Farmers , families with picnic baskets , ladies with parasols- all expecting a good show . Timlin : But it was a disaster ! Everyone thought the Union Army would teach the rebels a lesson . But the Confederates turned things around and won the day . Narrator B : The Battle of Bull Run-also known as the Battle of Manassas- lasted only a day , but it woke the nation to the severity of the conflict . About 3,000 of the Union 's 37,000 troops- and roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Russell : You Americans , it seems , are in for the fight of your lives . EPILOGUE Narrator C : Indeed , the fighting continued for four years , with more than 10,000 battles , mainly in the South . By the time the South surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia on April 9 , 1865 , 620,000 men from the North and South had been killed . The Civil War remains the most scarring period in U.S. history . -Kathy Wilmore &; Louis C. Adelman 
##4085459 Snow fell in wet , fat flakes as Grandpa picked me up after school . " Your mom 's running late , " he said . " How was your day ? " " Boring . " " Boring ? You do n't know boring , Austin . School is much more interesting now than it used to be . " " No way . " I set my heavy backpack down and buckled my seat belt . " When I was in fifth grade , we did n't have computers , Smart Boards , or the Internet , " Grandpa said . The windshield wipers slapped aside wet snow as we drove out of the parking lot . " I bet you did n't have as much homework . " " We had homework , " Grandpa said . " Boring homework . And day after day , we did work sheets and passed them to the person behind us to correct while we corrected the ones from the person in front of us . Now that was boring . " Grandpa stopped at a red light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat by a mile on boring school . I 'd love to be in fifth grade now . " I stared out the window at the falling snow . Adults loved talking about how hard things used to be . " There was one thing about my school that was better , " Grandpa said . " What ? " " We got recess three times a day . " " That 's no fair . " " Yup , morning , lunch , and afternoon . But the reason we did was that school was so boring . That 's my point . " I took my gloves off and wiggled my fingers . I could n't wait to get home to play my latest favorite video game : NBA 2Kl 1 . My team was heading for the finals . " Today would be just right for one of my favorite games , " Grandpa said . " What ? " " King of the Mountain . " I looked over at Grandpa and pretended to be interested . " When they cleared the playground , they 'd pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd race out to the pile and try to get to the top . Everybody else had the same goal , so there was lots of pushing and pulling . I loved that game . " Poor Grandpa . Kids back in the old days got excited about a pile of snow . I was glad I lived now , in the time of awesome electronic games . The snow was falling heavier as Grandpa pulled in front of my house . " Are n't you coming in ? " I asked . " No , I need to clear some of this snow . Your mom will be back in half an hour . She said traffic was slow because of the weather . " " Do you think we 'll have a snow day tomorrow and school will be called off ? " " Snow day ? We never had those when I was a kid . You guys have it easy now . " " Thanks for the ride , Grandpa . " I rushed inside to get to my game . The next morning , light flakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Snow day ? " I asked Mom , who was listening to the forecast . " Yes , six inches already , " she said . " But your dad and I still have to work . I 'll drop you off at your grandparents ' . " " I 'm old enough to be by myself , " I pleaded . " I 'll stay inside the whole time . " " What would you do ? " Dad poured himself more coffee . " Play my video games . I promise to stay right here . " " Your grandparents are eager for you to come over , " Mom said . " I 'd rather stay here . Grandpa will make me go outside . " " That 's not the worst thing in the world , " Dad said . " It will be boring . " I trudged back to my room . When Mom dropped me off , I hurried into the house and took off my hat , coat , and boots . " What do you want to do with your snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " I sat down in front of their old TV . I picked up the ancient remote : nothing but cooking shows and ladies talking about makeup . I switched the TV off . " I 've got a 500'piece jigsaw puzzle of the Tower of London and a 1,000-piece one of the Taj Mahal , " Grandma said . " I 'm not really into puzzles . " " You could help me mix ingrethents for chocolate chip cookies . " " Thanks , Grandma , but I 'd rather eat them . " " Let 's go out and shovel , " Grandpa said . " You can call a couple of friends and see if they 'll come over to help . Tell them they can eat as many cookies as they want afterward . " I got up from the couch . Grandpa did n't know that fifth-graders do n't do things for cookies anymore . I went to call just so he 'd think I was trying , and I was totally surprised when Caleb and Seth said they would help . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us dented metal shovels . The snow was heavier than I expected . We had to scoop it up and carry it over to the side of the driveway . With all the snow , I was afraid we might be stuck shoveling all day . " This is nothing , " Grandpa said . " When I was your age , we used to get a foot of snow , and we never got school called off . " As we were working , Grandpa 's neighbor drove up in his pickup with a plow on the front . He rolled down his window , and he and Grandpa talked . " Move to the sidewalk , boys . " Grandpa waved us over in front of the house . " Jeff 's going to plow us out . " " All right ! " Caleb cheered . " We still get cookies , " Seth said . I planted my shovel in the snow just in time . My back and arms were killing me . Jeff rattled the plow along the driveway and pushed the snow into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , and the pile grew . When Jeff was finished , Grandma called out from the front door and handed Grandpa a container of cookies for him . Caleb went over to the pile for a closer look , and Seth and I followed . It was four times as tall as we were , and chunks of snow stuck out at odd angles to forai a mountain with different levels . Caleb started climbing , but he slipped and slid to the bottom . 1 started up , but Seth pulled me by the back of my coat . I broke out of his grip , but Caleb grabbed me from behind and we both went tumbling down . I zipped my coat tighter and saw Emma and Ella , twins from our class who lived next door . " Your Grandpa said we could play , " Ella said . " Play what ? " Seth questioned . Suddenly , I knew the answer . " King of the Mountain , " I said . " Queen , " Emma corrected . " I 'm going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emma grabbed one of Caleb 's boots and Ella grabbed the other . Seth and I rolled around like polar bears and ended up sprawled in the snow at the bottom . Ethan and Armando , who lived across the street , joined in , and so did Jasmine and Trina , friends of Ella and Emma 's . Caleb , Seth , Armando , Ethan , and I faced off in a multilevel all-star wrestling match . Ella seized the opportunity to scramble to the top , but her glory time was short-lived because Trina pushed her aside . Armando crawled up and sent Trina tumbling . I saw an opening when everybody was focused on pulling him down . I raced behind the hill and climbed quickly . As Armando slid down , I scrambled up . " Look ! " Seth shouted . " Get Austin ! " Caleb yelled . But it was too late . I was alone at the top , and I felt taller than I ever had in my life . I could see all the way down the street . Kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waved to Grandpa , who gave me a thumbs-up . I was King of the Mountain . Later , when I was back home , I sat on the couch and instinctively reached for my controller . But then I set it down . I 'd already been to the top today . I closed my eyes and saw myself as King , with the wind blowing in my face and everyone looking up at me . Grandpa was right . That game was great , and I could n't wait to play again .
