But in so doing , I hope you all appreciate the legacy we leave . @!BAIER : Michael Steele stepping down as the RNC chairman . The election held on the seventh ballot . Reince Priebus won . He is the new Republican National Committee chairman , a former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party . Here is what the speaker of the House said about this , quote , " I 'd like to congratulate the members of the Republican National Committee for selecting the next chair . With the Senate and White House in play , house majority to defend , Republicans will face great challenges in the upcoming campaign . Reince can count on my support as we work to prepare the Republican candidates have resource and ground game needed to win the battle of ideas with President Obama and his Democratic allies . We will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " Weekly Standard , " A.B . Stoddard , associate editor of " The Hill , " and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer . A.B. , seven ballots , Reince Priebus is the winner . A.B . @!STODDARD , ASSOCIATE EDITOR , " THE HILL " : He was ahead all along , but it 's fascinating to see how divided the membership was that the anti- Steele faction could never unite seven ballots to get behind somebody who was never really a consensus candidate . They 're in trouble . They 're in over $20 million in debt . They have a lot of challenges to meet . But it 's interesting that he started out in weakness because he was not the consensus candidate . There is a lot of work to be done and they want to reposition the RNC as they try to take on Barack Obama in 2012 . And he has a big job ahead of him . But Michael Steele did not make it . When we woke up this morning we knew he was n't going to make it . @!BAIER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give a little filler . @!STEVE-HAYES-SENIO : Well , he was the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican party and provided over a successful tenure in Wisconsin . Look at the last election and Ron Johnson winning the Senate campaign against Russ Feingold . Priebus had reached out to Johnson and by Johnson 's own accounting , really helped get him in the race . @!BAIER : But he works behind the scenes more . @!HAYES : He is not flashy . He might do some media interviews , but he 's not like Michael Steele was . I think he 's in a unique position to turn things around he was there under Steele . He was loyal to Steele while he was there . But at the same time , he knows where the problems were and tried to them I think from inside , and now will have his own team to try to solve them . @!BAIER : Charles , it is interesting when you look at the finances that the RNC is in a bit of a hole , a big hole . But they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part because of others on the outside of the RNC who raised a lot of money . @!BAIER : The Republican Governor 's Association among them . @!KRAUTHAMMER : And the Karl Rove operation , a couple of private operations which raised money on the outside and helped a lot of candidates . So it 's hard to attribute the victory to the RNC . I 'm not sure it will have a large effect . Steele was gracious in resigning , throwing his support to another candidate who did n't win . He tried . He 's a good man , a good Republican , and a great politician , but in the wrong job . This is behind-the-scenes job . It 's now in the hands of someone who work behind the scenes , and the main issue is money and that is what he will work on . @!BAIER : Speaking of money , then Senator Obama ran campaign with $75 million in 2008 . Now the projection is it will take $1 billion to win the White House in 2012 . One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama has made out on the stump . @ ! BARACK-OBAMA-@1D@ : We did n't become the most prosperous country in the world by rewarding greed and recklessness . We did n't come this far by letting the special interest run wild . We did n't do it just by gambling and chasing paper profits on Wall Street . @!BAIER : Now business folks would say listen , it 's been a couple of years and now you 're going to ask me for money , big money for the reelection bid , A.B . Bill Daley , chief of staff , changes the dynamic a bit , but is it going to be hard for the Obama administration to raise a lot of money ? A.B . @!STODDARD , ASSOCIATE EDITOR , " THE HILL " : Very hard . They expect a minimum of $500 million to come from the outside group to help the Republican candidate . They look at disappointment among the unions and the groups that rally to the cause . The business community will not give to Barack Obama the way they did in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small online contributions . The excitement is not going to be there , not the same . So he is looking at what he thinks is a $1 billion election and he is seeking to raise money from dispirited base . And the deep pockets in the business community wo n't give to him the way they did before . @!BAIER : Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : In fact , in 2008 , the Wall Street community , big money they had given him over $40 million . He is not going to get that . Some will end up in the hands of Republicans . People who have been life-long Democrats are going to switch over as a result of the kind of rhetoric that we just saw Obama talking about Wall Street in pretty negative terms , and the policies . I think these are people who are looking at as you mention , the Bill Daley appointment , the banker , and they wo n't be fooled . This is two years where Obama will play the centrist , but people on Wall Street are the people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know if Obama is reelected he will be the Obama of 2009/2010 . When he 's unleashed and has no check on him in terms of another election . So I think they understand that this is a repositioning that is not actually going to be serious and he will be anti-business. @!BAIER : We may see more in " State of the Union " on the 25th . After that , he visits the chamber of commerce on the February 7 . Steve ? @!HAYES : Yes , it will be interesting . I think Charles is right . Business will be more wary of President Obama and the promises he make . I do n't think however that businesses and corporations and the big dollar donors give for ideological reasons . If they did we would n't have seen them give to President Obama in the first place . They give for access . And while there may be some falloff in the money he gets among small donors , I do n't think he will fight an uphill battle on funding . @!BAIER : Even with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform ? @!HAYES : No , because people want access to the person they think might be in power . If he shows he might remain in power , people will want a piece of that . @!KRAUTHAMMER : It 's not abstract ideology . It 's regulations that the government will impose on them and their livelihood . I think it impacts them directly . People will use their money to support other people in government who are not going to cut off their livelihoods. @!BAIER : So if campaigns cost too much , do you think the government should regulate them ? Vote in the online poll at **25;0;TOOLONG . The Friday lightning round is next . @!BAIER : Every week viewers vote in the your choice online , the first topic in the Friday lightning round . This is it . This week , the winner . Debt ceiling won with 64 percent of the vote . That 's not the poll , though . This is why they may have voted for it . This is the newest poll from Reuters saying are you in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 18 percent said support . That vote likely coming late spring . We 're back with the panel . A.B. ? @!STODDARD : Well , it 's so interesting seeing this polling that people , 71 percent of those polled say they would bring on default . They 're not afraid of us threatening the sovereign debt rating of the U.S. and inflation going up and all sorts of things , interest rates . It 's unbelievable as we see the debt crisis enveloping in other countries on the news . At same time , they 're not willing to find -- they do n't have consensus on what they would cut . So this is very , difficult issue for Republicans . The more I speak with them they become increasingly defensive about this because they do n't yet have , they do n't know where the chips will fall politically . We know they 're not going to fail to raise the debt ceiling . They will convince their membership this is something they must do . @!BAIER : Why is n't it difficult for Democrats ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to attach significant cuts to that vote , why is n't that politically perilous ? @!STODDARD : I just think it 's the luxury of the minority to vote against the increase of debt ceiling . They have to find votes in the Republican ranks . And so they are looking at between $16 and $100 million in cuts . They 'd like more . It 's hard to find them . Some members want $300 million in cut . It 's a difficult vote to get to . We do n't know who is going to get blamed . @!BAIER : Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : The reason it is the danger for Republicans is because , in the end , the ceiling those be raised no matter what . Democrats , the president is on the side of raising it . The bluff if called is called against Republicans . In the end , the leadership knows it has to cave so it has to make reasonable demands and not unreasonable ones . @!BAIER : Steve ? @!HAYES : But in the end , the president ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a tough position . Republicans here have hand . Republicans can make demands and serious demands about caps on spending that they 're likely to have the president acquiesce to . And what they 're doing now at a retreat in Baltimore with House Republicans and Senate retreat last Thursday is figuring out exactly what it will look like mechanically . @!BAIER : Tunisia , the government is falling apart there . What is the story ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : We have had civility for 30 years and all the Arab countries in North Africa , and with Tunisia , which was one of the most stable . Riots in Morocco and Algeria , instability in Syria and Egypt , even in Jordan , actually . All of our friends in the region , the pro-westerners , are now potentially in jeopardy . We have to be really careful here . We 're going to support elections but there are Islamists lurking in all of the countries . They have to be real care that we do n't get a repetition of what happened in Gaza where Hamas won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a huge problem in Tunisia . They do not , it 's a very secular state . They do not have a huge Islamist population . I think it 's good . They have kicked out authoritarian . Hopefully people around the region will look and say if we speak out and stand up , this can happen in our own country . @!BAIER : Final thing . Texas has the vanity plates , seven letters . People are paying astronomical amounts for them . We thought we 'd ask the panel . What is your seven-letter plate ? @!STODDARD : I did n't want to take Falcons because I wanted to leave it for you . @!BAIER : Thanks . @!STODDARD : Mine is the L.A. Lakers in honor of my son and his father 's passion for the team . I was going to go something more cerebral , but I just decided to go with a team . @!BAIER : Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : Mine is " head doc , " because when a psychotic goes on a rampage and malicious nitwits on the lift attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palin , I pull my stethoscope out of retirement , hang my shingle , and I do a bit psychiatry . And the plate is a warning . Do n't try this again . I know something about this . @!BAIER : All right , Steve ? @!HAYES : I hate vanity plates . They drive me crazy . My first inclination is try to come up with something that looks like a vanity plate and was n't so it would confuse people that drove behind me . But instead I went simple and said " h8vpltz. " @!BALDWIN : Very clever . I was torn . One was " with an e . " There is a Brit/Bret thing -- with an " e . " But then that was too -- I thought I 'd go with something more , right down the middle , " Balance . " You know , fair and balanced . @!STODDARD : Unafraid. @!BAIER : Could n't fit " unafraid . " That 's eight . That 's it for panel , but stay tuned for license plate antics . @!BAIER : Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there is one state that may be adding them to more types of vehicles . But there could be some problems . @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : New Jersey lawmakers are considering a plan that could require bicycles to have license plates . Many elderly people have been hit by bicycles recent months but have no way to identify the riders . Proponents of the plan wonder if elderly people would even be able to read the license plates in the event of an accident . Taking this into account , the license plates would be manufactured and easy to read large print . New Jersey , stopping ? I 'm staying . @!BAIER : Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight . Make a great weekend . That 's it for " Special Report , " fair , balanced and unafraid . That 's eight letters . ' 
##4082553 @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Now former speaker Newt Gingrich goes " On the Record . " He is the author of the book " To Save America . " It is not out in paperback . @!Mr-Speaker-nice-t# @!NEXT-GINGRICH-@1R : Great to see you . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Starting this weekend a Republican retreat in Baltimore . You are going to be one of the speakers . What do you intend to do at this retreat ? @!GINGRICH : I think the Republicans have a great opportunity to develop a new approach creating hope and opportunity for the whole country . I 'm going to propose that one-third of the hearings they set up focus on science and technology and new breakthroughs and give the country a sense of what we could be doing if we were using our best people , following our best ideas , and the kind of breakthroughs in Alzheimer 's , diabetes , and a whole range of areas that we could have if we had better government . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : That 's the health area . Obviously there 's a huge amount of interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is your party going to get the Hispanic vote ? That 's has growing importance in the election . @!GINGRICH : It is a very good example . I think you have to include Americans of all backgrounds in what you are doing . I also think there 's an opportunity for Republicans . We developed a program call the Americano.com . Jeb Bush is hosting an event in Miami with former Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez . On values , on pocketbook issues , national security , on a wide range of issues there 's a lot in common between Republicans and Hispanic-American businesses and Hispanic-American small business owners , Hispanic-American family values . Can we move from 38 percent to above 50 percent buy 2012 ? I think we can because I think we have a very powerful message , including a calm , steady approach to ending illegality and finding ways to deal with immigration that are acceptable to conservatives and Hispanic-Americans. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : The issue of illegal immigration versus legal immigration is of importance to everybody , and hugely to the Hispanic population . What can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party would do that would make Hispanics who are mostly interested in that issue want to vote Republican ? @!GINGRICH : First , you have to develop control of the border and you have to say that 's step one in a several step process . The American people absolutely , including most Hispanic-Americans , want control of the border . I 'm talking to you tonight from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina where four Mexican drug dealers were recently picked up here in the largest heroin arrest in the history of this area . All across the country there are gangs . Hispanic-Americans want to get rid of those gangs as much or more as anyone else because they are a direct threat to their families , their livelihood , their safety . There are things you can do together . We clearly have to get effective guest worker program . One of my proposals tomorrow is going to turn to American Express , Visa , MasterCard , have people who are experts fighting fraud develop a guest worker card and program that allows us to have effective control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating -- it does require a guest worker program . But I think most Americans would agree getting to the point where no one was here illegal and having a legal system is an important step . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Would that be concurrent with securing the borders ? @!GINGRICH : I think first of all the American people have every right to demand as a matter of national security that we control the border . If we control the border , you dramatically reduce drug flow in the United States . You would dramatically reduce any dangers of infiltration by terrorists . You would in fact reduce substantially the challenge of illegal immigration . At the same time , because it is going to take a while to build a guest worker card and program , I would start down the road . I would say you would like to be available the day the border is controlled , you would like to be able to have a guest worker card and program so people could cross the border legally to a legal job having a legal guest worker program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border , but you would be developing it at the same time you are developing a control of the border . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Next , more with Speaker Gingrich . He has some trips planned to some very fishy places . It 's time to talk 2012 . That 's next . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Continuing with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : There 's papers today in South Carolina quote you saying in terms of 2012 that South Carolina is such an important state , number three of the primary . Why is South Carolina so important when you Iowa and New Hampshire out there before you ? @!GINGRICH : Well , Iowa and New Hampshire are very important . I 'll be in Iowa later this month for the Iowa Biofuel and Renewable Fuel association . I will be in New Hampshire next month . All three are very important . I think one of the great things about the American system is relatively small states where people get to know you personally , where you are there face-to-face , not just having consultants to raise money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street talking to folks , these states have a very big impact upon who has a chance to become president . As you know , Calista and I will make a decision the end of February about whether or not to color the presidential campaign and test the waters . For the moment we are not focused on that . We are still doing a lot of other things . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Some critics would say why should these states pick the nominee ? A lot of people are critical of the Iowa caucus procedure . They say , why does Iowa get to pick the nominee for the party ? It is a big country and a lot of members of your party across the country . @!GINGRICH : No one state gets to pick the nominee . When Ronald Reagan won the nomination in 1980 I think he was still campaigning in late May to get the nomination . They allow people with relatively little money to have a real chance to emerge in a way -- Jimmy Carter probably could n't have gotten into the process without Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upset Ronald Reagan in Iowa which he could n't have done in a state the size of Illinois or Pennsylvania . I 'm a fan of if things are n't broke do n't fix them . I believe the system we have now , the Iowa caucuses followed by the New Hampshire primary , followed by South Carolina leading into the other states , Nevada , Michigan , I think the system works reasonably well . We ought to allow it to continue to work . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : In terms of Iowa , the caucus , if you have a job that does n't let you takeoff the night of the caucus , you ca n't vote . Maybe you can take often morning and vote in a state like New Hampshire , and in Iowa , you are excluded from the system in both parties . @!GINGRICH : First of all , if you look the tremendous turn out for candidate Obama in 2008 , I do n't think anybody was excluded . Second , if you care enough you find a way to get a substitute for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right , a test of intensity that starts and aims August 13th , when people have to give up a Saturday a long time before the election . Then early next year you have to go out on a Monday night in potentially a snow storm in is the Midwest in the middle of winter , and that is a test of how serious people are about their candidate . Shortly thereafter you go to New Hampshire regular primary then come down to South Carolina . In the opening weeks you 've been in the Midwest . You 've been in the northeast . And you 've been in the south . Now with adding Nevada you 've been in the west in the first weeks an affordable pace for unknown candidates . For somebody like Governor Pawlenty or Senator Thune just starting out or Senator Sanatorium , you have an enormously open and equal opportunity model to allow talent to emerge . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You have a website noObamacare.com , aiding in efforts to repeal the national health care . What is going to happen in the House ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does it have some sort of power or impetus does it do something ? @!GINGRICH : It is more than symbolic . Passing by a substantial margin the repeal of Obama care is a very important first step . We have now over 100,000 signatures and they are growing every day . Our goal is to target the 23 Democratic senators who are up for election in 2012 -- excuse me -- and be in a position to have the maximum number of signatures ask them to vet to repeal Obamacare . The Center for Health Transformation going to release tomorrow its third chart on Obamacare . This is a 50 square foot chart that lists the 1,969 grant of authority the Secretary of Health and Human Services in Obamacare . Thing about that , 1,969 grants of power over your health care to a single bureaucrat in Washington , D.C. I think combined with our earlier charts of 159 new offices under Obamacare and a 50 square foot chart of all the deadlines under Obamacare , those three charts are devastating examples of why we should repeal Obamacare. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the momentum , whether in the House or federal courts on -- you think he 's worried something is going to happen to national health care ? @!GINGRICH : I do n't know . But I would think just as a practical person he has to be concerned that every poll shows a majority of Americans favor appeal . He has to be concerned that a federal judge has out the centerpiece of mandates in the bill . He has to be concerned that even Democrats are starting to introduce bills that allow states to be exempt . I think Senator Wyden of Oregon is introducing a bill with a Republican that would allow states to get out of Obamacare . I think he 's got to have some sense that this is n't working the way he thought it would . I would be very surprised if he does n't realize that . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Mr. Speaker nice to see you . We 'll look forward to having you back on . @!GINGRICH : It will be fun . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Next , these might become your favorite YouTube videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen our top stories , but here is " The Best of the Rest . " Guaranteed you are going to love this -- eight-year-old Elizabeth Hughes had the thrill of singing the national anthem at a Norfolk Admirals hockey game . Unfortunately some technical problems interrupted her song . But the crowd did not let the little girl down . @ ( SINGING ) @!VAN-SUSTEREN : That 's great , is n't it ? Let 's face it , there is nothing newsworthy about this next story , but we ca n't help it . We do have to show it . This YouTube video is going viral . It 's called " Eating Grapefruit " and it shows a 10-month-old girl named Penny eating grapefruit . Her face -- priceless. @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : This is Penny on grapefruit juice . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Apparently Penny actually loves grapefruit , and of course we love that video . Finally , no matter how many of times you see it , it never gets less incredible . Mouth Etna , the volcano in Sicily just erupted for about 12 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one was injured in the latest eruption . And there you have it , " The Best of the Rest . " But still ahead , is the Chinese president about to put President Obama in a very awkward spot ? Stay tuned . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : ( CROSSTALK ) You never know what 's happening behind the scenes in the world of foreign policy . @ ! JAY-LENO-HOST- " T : Next week Chinese president Hu Jintao will be at the White House . And the good news , he has no plans to foreclose . We can stay another month ! Yes ! @!VAN-SUSTEREN : OK , that is good news . And that your last call , lights are blinking and we are closing down shop go . Thanks for being with us tonight . I 'm going to put an open thread on Gretawire.com . Go there and blog . " The O'Reilly Factor " is next . Goodnight from Washington . ' 
##4082554 GRETA @!VAN-SUSTEREN , HOST : Tonight , Karl Rove and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are both here to go " On the Record . " But first , the accused Arizona 's killer 's ex-girlfriends -- they 're talking . A girl who dated Jared Loughner in high school thinks he never planned to survive the attack . @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I think he actually expected to get shot that day because if you looked at his FaceBook and his YouTube , everything was written in past tense . That 's not common , that you write things in past tense unless you 're expecting that you 're going to commit suicide or something bad 's going to happen to you . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Yes , but there 's a lot of people out there right now who are saying Jared Loughner is mentally ill . I know you 're not a doctor , but your gut feeling -- is he mentally ill , or do you think it 's just kind of an accumulation of everything that you 've talked about ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think -- honestly , I think he 's faking everything . I think the outburst that he had in class -- I think he 's planned everything . ( INAUDIBLE ) I think that he has been planning this for some time . It was like staring into somebody you did n't know , like he did n't care about anything , like he had this kind of attitude that it did n't matter . Nothing mattered and ... @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : There was nothing behind his eyes ? Is that what you 're saying ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : It was like staring into someone soulless , basically . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Did you see a decline , like a noticeable decline ? Was he much more , quote , unquote , " normal " in high school , as opposed to when you saw him three or four months ago ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Yes . He was different . He had common decency . You could see he had a big heart for people . But I do n't know what happened . I really do n't because that 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't know that he would do something like this ( INAUDIBLE ) ever escalate into something like this . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Another high school ex-girlfriend says she was stunned when she learned who was accused of going on that vicious rampage in Tucson . @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : It was probably one of the more surprising things I 've ever heard in my life . I 'd been at work that day and I 'd heard pieces of characteristic ( ph ) things about this person who had done all this . And then finally , when I had been given the name of who it was , everything just fell together and I could n't believe it . And it was very emotional . I was very upset . Six years ago , we dated and he -- back then , he was completely different of a person , very caring , very sweet , gentle , kind , you know , a little bit quiet , but altogether , a pretty great guy . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Did you ever see anything in Jared that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence tendencies ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Absolutely not , no . The Jared that I used to know is completely changed from what the world sees him now as . You know , I would never have ever expected him to become what he has . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And tonight , we have newly released police transmissions from immediately after the massacre that give us a chilling glimpse of what happened behind the scenes on that horrible day . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : A car is reporting a shooting now with a semi- automatic weapon . He shot at people and he was last seen headed towards the Walgreen . He ran northbound out of the store wearing a black hoodie and bluejeans . And now we have a caller who believes Gabrielle Giffords was shot , and multiple victims . Sounds like many people are shot . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And there 's more news out of tonight , a possible clue . A black bag has been found . Who found it , and what 's in it ? FOX 's Griff Jenkins is on the ground in Tucson -- Griff. @!GRIFF-JENKINS-FOX : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the black bag belonging to Jared Loughner that was seen by his father on the morning of the shooting . At about 10:00 AM this morning , an 18-year-old man walking his dog just a few blocks from the Loughners home found what looked to be a diaper bag in the shape of a backpack which contained 9-millimeter ammunition consistent with the gun that Jared used on that Saturday morning , that horrific shooting . They also found some items that were believed to be purchased at Wal-Mart . That bag has been turned over now to the custody of the FBI . Also today , we were able to confirm that the former high school friend of Jared Loughner -- his name is Zach Osler -- he 's spoken out about Loughner 's -- his relationship with Loughner , his mental state in the past . We confirmed that he worked at the gun store where Loughner bought that gun on November 30th , but that Zach Osler was not at work that day . We went by his house to speak with him to see if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't available . His parents came out and talked to me , Greta , and they talked about the tremendous toll that this story is having on their son and the family . And we witnessed it firsthand because Zach came from within the house and slammed the door violently , a real testament to the impact that this story is having on the community . And finally , a bittersweet moment here at the memorial at the hospital behind me . Ron Barber , Gabrielle Giffords 's district manager , came out in a wheelchair . He was shot twice . He was one of the 14 victims . He came out in a wheelchair to observe the memorial , to see the kind things that have been placed and written here . And holding his hand was a woman , a total stranger named Anna Ballis ( ph ) , who on that day , a total stranger , came to his aid and perhaps saved his life . She is , as she described , his special angel . They spent a moment together . All the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very touching -- Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Griff , thank you . @!OK-this-next-repo# @ ! DR-PETER-RHEE-MED : We saw signs of this coming , so we were just , you know , talking amongst ourselves , saying , you know , it 'd be great if this would happen . ( INAUDIBLE ) you know , the president came in the room because the eyes -- it was n't like she was out all the time . But we saw signs the eyes were flickering and they were starting to come around . You saw the lights and sparkle occurring . And the fact that the timing was so great was all good for I think everybody involved . @!DR-MICHAEL-LEMOLE , : But to your point , yes , miracles happen every day . And in medicine , we like to very much attribute them to either what we do or others do around us . But a lot of medicine is outside of our control , and we 're -- we 're wise to acknowledge miracles . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And today , just what we want , more good news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both her legs and arms and responding to friends and family . Forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden joins us live . Good evening , Dr. Baden . @!DR-MICHAEL-BADEN- : Hi . Good evening , Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Doctor , the swelling has n't gotten worse . We do n't hear anything about a fever . She 's breathing on her own , but she 's got a tube down her throat . Her eyes are open . She 's tracking . She 's moving her right arm , left arm , right leg , left leg . It 's just all good news . Is it possible she could recover fully ? @!BADEN : She can recover almost fully . There 's some nerve damages that are n't going to go away . But as the swelling goes away , more function will occur . When the bullet goes into the skull , in the front of the skull , it causes tearing of nerves and it also causes swelling of the brain . The tearing of the nerves does n't go away , but the swelling does . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital centers of the brain . So she breathing . She 's -- be able to talk . She 'll be able to think . And she -- Greta , she might be going back to Congress before the end of the session in May . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Dr. Baden , you say the nerves above the vital center of the brain are the ones that have the problem , or ... @!BADEN : Right . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : ... have been -- have gotten the damage . What does that do , I mean , typically ? I mean , or is there nothing that is sort of typical ? But if those are damaged , how does it manifest itself ? @!BADEN : Well , it could manifest itself in partial paralysis , like , it goes on the left side of the brain and it damages the nerves that go to the right arm and leg . But the reports this morning and today were that the arm and the leg are moving , so that it looks like there 'll be a great deal of recovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the fact that it did n't hit any of the vital centers in the brain , which are lower down , means that she could have a good mental recovery . She 'll be able to talk , be able to think is a real possibility . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : So what 's the -- what 's the limitation ? And does -- I thought that some nerves regenerate itself . Is that not true ? I mean , if you have some surgery , then you -- sometimes the nerves do repair ? @!BADEN : Well , that 's the goal , occasionally . But brain cells thus far do n't regenerate . And that 's one of the hopes of stem cell treatments is that , eventually , nerves -- cells in the brain will regenerate . But the swelling -- much of the impairment that she has now is due to the swelling of the brain , so that as the swelling goes down , those nerves will come back to normal . When they 're swollen , they are not functioning as well , so that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more before there 's a better sense of how much impairment she will have . But clearly ... @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , I -- I ... @!BADEN : ... she 's surviving . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , I so desperately want her to get better that I -- you know , so that I 'm looking for ... @!BADEN : Right . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : ... only good news . You know , I , you know , admit that . But -- and we do n't know if , when they take the tube out , whether she can speak . But the fact that you say that the -- that it did n't hit -- that it 's above the vital nerve -- the vital part of the brain -- can we have a good -- a good shot at the -- I do n't want to use the word shot , that 's a terrible word , but a good chance that she 'll be able to speak ? @!BADEN : Greta , you 're going to be in D.C. come May , and I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in to Congress by May , near where your office is. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Well , we look forward to seeing her . She 's been in the studio before , and you know , I , like -- I welcome the day when I look out the door and she 's coming through that studio door . Dr. Baden , thank you , sir . @!BADEN : Thanks , Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Now , we know accused killer Jared Loughner has a dark , checkered past at school . Griff Jenkins has new equally bizarre information about Loughner 's employment history . @!JENKINS : Today , Greta , we 're learning in the local newspaper a little more details of Jared Loughner 's recent employment history . It appears that he came here , to the Pima County One-Stop Job Resources Center several times in recent months to try and get help getting a job . What 's known about his employment is that he had a string of retail jobs that he either left or was fired from . The story in the news today is that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jared Loughner came here at the center , walked in the doors with a videocamera rolling , filming the staff , making them uncomfortable . Mary Brideski ( ph ) , the director here , who confirmed the story for us but was n't allowed to go on camera , told us that she asked Loughner to leave , was making the staff very uncomfortable , at which time Loughner pulled out a Constitution , began waving it wildly , saying it was his right to do so . She asked him to leave , which he did . He would return one more time with the same erratic behavior and again he left . Loughner also volunteered his time here at the Pima Animal Care Center . But he got himself into trouble when he was walking the dogs . He was doing it in an area around here considered unsafe , dangerous for the animals . Supervisors told him not to walk the dogs there , but according to the manager here , Kim James ( ph ) , he did n't seem to comprehend what he was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked not to return . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Coming up : We are all heartbroken by the murder of 9- year-old Christina Taylor Green . The woman who was with little Christina that day , though , she survived being shot . What was the last thing the woman remembers seeing ? Her husband tells you next , and it will give you chills . And Congress is getting back to business , and repeal -- well , it 's in the air ! Karl Rove and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich minutes away . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : We 're all heartbroken by the murder of Christina Taylor Green , the 9-year-old girl gunned down on Saturday . Her funeral was today . You might not know , though , the story of Susie Hileman , Christina 's next- door neighbor , who took the little girl to the event to meet Congresswoman Giffords . Susie was also shot , but she survived the attack . How she is she doing ? Griff talked to Susie 's husband , Bill Hileman. @!JENKINS : Bill , how is Susie doing ? @!BILL-HILEMAN-HUSB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her second major surgery to repair a fractured hip the day before . And that operation went well . She was able to avoid a full hip replacement . And she 's pinned and plated back together and will face a long rehab , but should expect a pretty fair percentage of what she was formally capable of . She 's being moved off the ICU . Basically , her vitals are stable to that extent , so we 're all very encouraged , as of today . Above and beyond that , her pain medication for quite a number of days kept her in a very foggy mental state , and communication was tough and sporadic at best . We 're back to full paragraphs now , and I feel like I got my wife back . @!JENKINS : Bill , there are emotional issues involved . You had to inform your wife that Christina had died . Tell me about that and tell me how she 's doing and what 's the plan going forward with that ? I know that 's going to be a very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clear-headed , shared with me more details of what had happened at the scene . And the last thing she had remembered at the scene was being on the ground , hand in hand , face to face with Christina and not quite knowing what happened . Clearly , that image was what was in her head when Saturday night , after her initial trauma surgery , the sedation wore off and the breathing tube came out and she looked me in the eye and said , How 's Christina ? And Susie is someone that you deal with straightforward , but beyond that , the social work staff here had very early on recognized the difficulty of this issue for her to face and advised very strongly to be as direct with her in my response as possible . I informed her Christina did n't make it . And she 's been coping with that since . In moments of clear-headed lucidity -- Susie was social worker in her professional career who dealt with some of the worst family tragedies anyone could imagine . So the backbone is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , she knows that there 's no blame to be cast here , that they both suffered in the acts of a madman that was random and not to be predicted . In those other moments , where one is a little weak , it gets a little dark , and you do a different kind of soul-searching , she goes to very uncomfortable places . And she 's , I assume , going to need help . I may as well myself . But we know it 's going to be an ongoing issue . It is possibly made somewhat better by the generosity the Greens themselves have extended to us , starting with Roxanna the morning after , on Sunday morning , she sent Susie an e-mail just absolutely reiterating their love for our family , the appreciation they always had for the relationship Susie and Christina had developed , and their assurance that they wanted us to be everything together that we used to be . And they 're ongoing -- in fact , John just called this morning to get an update on Susie 's condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his daughter . These people are amazing . They 're strong . And they lost an absolutely jewel of a daughter . And I 'm sure the nation 's heartstrings are tugged just as tight as mine are , in addition . @!JENKINS : I 'm assuming you met and Susie met with the president and -- what could you share with us about that ? @!HILEMAN : Funny one for Susie . The family members were already taken over to McKale Center by the time the president made it to the ward here . I did have a close friend , a local young friend of Susie 's that was here . And the president and his -- I 'm told this . I did n't eyewitness it . The president and his wife come walking into the room . And my wife is a relatively hard-bitten New Yorker who inherited from her mother the ability to discipline children with nothing but a look in the eyes . And something about -- as the president approached and she was sort of waking up , apparently , that look came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great , big hug . Upon recognizing who it was , I 'm told Susie gave him a great , big one of these , and they had quite a moment together after that . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Next , Congress is about to get back to work , and you know what that means , the R-word , repeal ! Karl Rove goes " On the Record " next . And guess where former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is going this weekend ? Here 's a hint . President Obama was there last year . Speaker Gingrich is here minutes away . ' 
##4082555 @ ! PRES-BARACK-OBAMA- : Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame . @!SEAN-HANNITY-HOST : The president called for civility at last night 's memorial , but did he go far enough ? Should he tell his own party to tone it down ? More disturbing details emerge about the Tucson shooter from blog posts to his run-in with local police . And were there other death threats ? More bad news for the economy . The job market continues to struggle . Foreclosures were up . So , how do we turn things around ? Senator Rand Paul says he has the answers . @ ! SEN-RAND-PAUL-@1R- : They 're just in some rage , every night with ugly talk , ugly-sounding talk . @!HANNITY : Plus , our weekly analysis of the mainstream media bias . This week , we focus on the Tucson shooting aftermath . We are on the road to 2012. @!HANNITY starts right now . Now , more than slot for the McKale Center on the campus of the University of Arizona last night to remember the victims of Saturday 's horrific shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama were among the more than 26,000 who were in attendance . Now , during his remarks , the president spoke individually about the Americans lost in this tragedy as well as some of the heroes that rose up on that faithful morning . Now , he also took the opportunity to distance himself from the political finger pointing that we have seen in recent days . Take a look . @ ! OBAMA- : And if , as has been discussed in recent days , their deaths helps usher in more civility in our public discourse . Let us remember , it is not because a simple act of civility caused this tragedy , it did not . But rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation , in a way that would make them proud . @!HANNITY : And that was the message that President Obama sent last night . But many on their left are not heeding his advice including some of the top Democrats in Congress . Now , according to Congressman James Clyburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives , the shooter who he called a gentleman was influenced by political rhetoric . @ ! REP-JAMES-CLYBURN- : I think that what has happened here is that the vitriol has gotten so elevated until people feel emboldened by this . And people are a little less than stable , and people are n't thinking for themselves are so easily influenced , they go out and do things that all of us pay a great price for . @!HANNITY : Now , on the Senate side , Dick Durbin appears to be taking a different stance on the shooting on the president , he is blaming conservatives for Saturday 's massacre . @ ! DICK-DURBIN-@1D@2 , : The phrase do n't retreat , reload . Putting crosshairs on congressional districts as targets . These sorts of things , I think , invite the kind of toxic rhetoric that can lead unstable people to believe this is an acceptable response . @!HANNITY : Now , comments like that in mind , did the president go far enough to condemn the rhetoric of members of his own party ? Joining me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only Juan Williams . Juan , good to see . @!JUAN-WILLIAMS-FOX : Good to see you , Sean . @!HANNITY : All right . As always , I appreciate you being here . All right . Look , I 'm going to probably surprise you with this analysis . But there 's a but here , there 's a but coming . @!WILLIAMS : All right . @!HANNITY : I thought the speech was extraordinary well delivered . I thought it was eloquent at times . I thought he hit the right pitch and the right tone . That surprises you ? @!WILLIAMS : I 'm speechless . I 'm not allowed to be speechless . But basically , you know , I mean you beat him up a lot , so yes . I think that it was a terrific speech . He was a little too cool for me , because I do n't know there is any way I could have talked about Christina Taylor-Green , the little girl who was bury , you know , whose funeral was held today without breaking up . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the puddles in heaven for her and when he spoke about us as Americans having to live up to her ideal about what American politics should be . And that to me , you know , speaking about the people who lost their lives . That 's what this was about . It is not about politics . @!HANNITY : Well , this is the problem . It 's not about politics . You and I agree on this . I have a 9-year-old little girl . I agree with you , that family is like everybody else , all the victims in this tragedy or in my prayer . I was surprised a little bit at the pep rally atmosphere there . Did that take you a little bit by surprise ? @!WILLIAMS : Yes and I heard today , it took the White House by surprise too . In fact , Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman said that they did n't think there would going to be any applause lines in that speech . And if you notice Sean , the president was speaking over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he was ready for it or did n't anticipate it , so there was a little bit of a disconnect there . But , you know , the thing is , you have a bunch of college kids . I understand that almost as many people outside as they were inside this basketball arena and I wonder if it was n't like just an outpouring , like a second line in New Orleans or like an Irish wake . You know , people just filled with grief and looking for a reason to not let it out . @!HANNITY : Look , and Irish wake , there 's laughing , there 's crying , there 's carrying on . I mean , I can tell you from experience , unfortunately . But , all right , here 's the but , and you can -- this is where we may find some disagreement . My issue is , while the speech was well delivered . The words were right . I think , in spite of the crowd -- the crowd set the tone . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was them . The problem is , the speech to me , is a contradiction of who Barack Obama is . You know , if they bring a knife , we 'll bring a gun . You know , his past associations . The Republicans are enemies . They can sit in the back . All of this was said just before this election . So , I find myself , at a point where these words kind of ring a little hollow . @!WILLIAMS : Well , that line about , you know , they bring a knife , we bring a gun , that comes from the movie " The Untouchables , " and there was a context there . But your point is well taken . I think that he had in a sense had to evolve and had to learn something not only from this , but I think he 's had to take on more of a leadership , a stature issue here in terms of how he addresses us as an American family . He ca n't be in the pit throwing spitballs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to behave . He 's going to have to stand a little taller . So , if you want to say , that 's the but , well , you know , OK . But I must say , I do n't think that it was mostly Barack Obama . I think when you heard Speaker Boehner the other day say , there 's a lot of scar tissue on both sides on the House of Representatives . @!HANNITY : Yes . @!WILLIAMS : They play really rough over there and they called a grudge , that 's where I think the heart and soul of this problem has been . @!HANNITY : You know , this does n't bother me . You know , you are in the public arena , I 'm in the public arena . You know what , we are called names all the time . Especially you and by the way , you deserve it a lot more than me . All right . But in all seriousness , I do n't mind fierce debate . But that 's not what happened in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country named names . They tried to blame FOX News and Governor Palin and Rush Limbaugh and RFK , Jr . writes a piece calls , " Me a Merchant of Hate , " and compares me and with things I 've say to the atmosphere that killed his uncle JFK . If everyone was so concerned about the tone , why did n't we hear about any of this when George Bush was president ? @!WILLIAMS : Well , it 's a good point . But look , the whole thing is reprehensible . Because there is no way to draw any line , any point of causation to say , this is why this man Jared Loughner pulled his trigger and committed this atrocity . There 's no way unless you are starting to think in political terms . Now , I think you are wrong when you say all Democrats are doing this . I think there are some people who are so locked to their political mindset that they are looking for advantage and they think back to what happened with Clinton after Oklahoma City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . Some people say , Ronald Reagan got a bump after he was assassinated . I think all of these people , they should go home . Look , this is a moment when we as an American family have to pull together . I know we can have differences . But , you know what , we are all human beings . And it is important at this moment to make it clear . There was no one who caused Jared Loughner to do what he did . But whatever mania , psychosis is in lock his mind . @!HANNITY : All right . The only thing I want to say in response , I just played the comments of James Clyburn , I played the comments of Dick Durbin . We know what the sheriff has said out there . We know what Krugman has said . We know what all these guys have said one . And I got to tell you something . None of this is true . What we 've learned is this kid , he did n't listen to talk radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this congresswoman , long before the Tea Party when Sarah Palin came onboard. @!WILLIAMS : Yes he did . And here 's the thing I would say to you Sean . It is clear that we have a highly polarized , very sharp , and I think at times , too sharp level of anger expressed across the political aisles in this country . I do n't think we need it . @!HANNITY : Wait a minute , Clyburn was there last night . @!WILLIAMS : Yes . @!HANNITY : He was clapping as the president made those remarks . @!WILLIAMS : Well , that 's right . And I think those remarks deserved applause . But I do n't think we need Clyburn should come back and somehow then say , you know what , blame it on the Republicans . I mean , that 's just under touched , you know , the heart of the moment , the feeling . @!HANNITY : I agree . All right . And by the way , credit to you , you 're somebody on the left , you Ed Rendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done this and that 's a credit to you . All right . And before we take a quick break , special programming all for you on Monday night , right here live on @!HANNITY . Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin will be with us in her very first TV appearance since the tragedy in Tucson . We will have her exclusive reaction to the horrific accusations that were made against her . That 's Monday night , 9 Eastern . And still to come tonight , the girlfriend of Jared Lee Loughner is breaking her silence . Wait until you hear she says about how long Loughner has been planning this massacre . It will leave you stunned . All of that , plus Senator Rand Paul and much more , straight ahead . ' 
##4082556 BILL , O'REILLY , FOX NEWS HOST : The O'REILLY FACTOR is on @!Tonight @ ! BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : What we can not do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other . O'REILLY : President Obama talking tough against the merchants of hate in the media . Was the President 's speech effective and will anything change ? Bernie Goldberg , Laura Ingraham and your humble correspondent will analyze . @ ! REP-PETER-KING-@1R : I believe it 's important to have this investigation on radicalization of the Muslim community . O'REILLY : On the heels of the Arizona debacle , some are saying Congressman Peter King should not single out American Muslims for investigation . We 'll have a debate . @ ! SARAH-PALIN-@1R@2 , : Acts of monstrous criminalities stand on their own . They begin and end with the criminals who commit them . O'REILLY : And where are Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann who are attacking the Arizona fiasco ? They have not appeared this week in the national media and the " Culture Warriors " are investigating . Caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FACTOR begins right now . Hi , I 'm Bill O'Reilly . Thanks for watching us tonight . President Obama and the smear merchants : that is the subject of this evening 's " Talking Points " memo . Most fair-minded Americans I believe recognize that President Obama gave an excellent speech in Tucson , Arizona last night speaking in front of a largely student-laden audience , some of whom did not quite understand that they were attending a memorial service . The President hit all the right points in defining the terrible atrocity that took place last Saturday . First of all the President addressed the mercs -- @ ! OBAMA- : Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding . In the words of Job , " When I looked for light , then came darkness " . Bad things happen . And we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath . O'REILLY : President Obama went on to say that crimes like murder are incomprehensible and assigning outside blame without any evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far left zealots blame the atrocious crimes on conservatives . @ ! OBAMA- : At a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do , it 's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we 're talking with each other in a way that -- that heals , not in a way that wounds . O'REILLY : Nice thought , unlikely to happen . Simply but many liberals are furious that the progressive agenda is not working and many conservatives are angry because they feel their country is being badly damaged by forces on the left . And so there is hatred in the air and it all bubbled up after the Arizona mayhem . President Obama 's call for civility is obviously reasonable but he 's up against it . That 's because some of his most ardent supporters started the brawl this week by accusing the right of pushing Jared Loughner to violence . As we have reported many Americans are appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been doing for years . @!MONTEL-WILLIAMS-H : So Michelle , slit your wrists ? Go ahead , why not ? And if you do n't want to , I mean , or -- or you know , do -- do us all a better thing , move that knife up about two feet . Start right at the collarbone. @!MIKE-MALLOY-HOST , : I 'm waiting for the day when I pick it up -- and pick up a newspaper or click on the Internet and found he 's choked to death on his own throat fat or a great blob of saliva or something . You know , whatever , go away Rush , you make me sick . @!ED-SCHULTZ-HOST- : He is an enemy of the country in my opinion , Dick Cheney is . He is an enemy of the country . Lord , take him to the Promised Land , will you . See I do n't even wish the guy goes to hell , I just want him to get the hell out of here . O'REILLY : Now " Talking Points " well understand this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should heed Mr. Obama 's call . These are tough times in America , robust debate is needed but enough is enough with the hateful ideological loons . And that 's the memo now . For the " Top Story " reaction let 's bring in our pal Bernie Goldberg from Miami who 's been closely following this big media story . Let me say a couple of things first , Bernie . Nine-year-old Christina Green buried today in a funeral was not covered by the media . They apparently wanted it private and everybody respected that , thank God . Second of all , you and -- and me , we are pretty similar in our -- analytic techniques and I think -- @!BERNIE-GOLDBERG-F : Right . O'REILLY : -- people who watch this program would understand that we stay away from personal attacks usually . I mean , you -- you 've written books that -- that have provocative titles , but you probably -- you -- you like to back things up with facts , just like the montage we just showed . @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three people who said those are horrible hateful things . We just showed them , ok , without the personal attacks . But now , President Obama , the most powerful man in the world is drawn into this debate . He 's drawn into right in the middle of cable news , talk radio , ideological newspapers . How did he do last night ? @!GOLDBERG : Well , the diplomatic thing Bill , would be to simply say it was an eloquent speech which I think it was . And that he 's absolutely right in our need to lower the rhetoric . For the record , I 'm all for having a more civil national conversation , but I do n't think the President understands how difficult this is going to be because as a political person I do n't think he really understands that this polarization does n't stem from political differences . It goes much , much deeper than that . I as a conservative , simply think liberals are wrong on many issues . I also think they 're well-intentioned they mean well even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think conservatives are simply wrong , they think conservatives are morally inferior . That is why it 's so easy to -- to say that prominent conservatives are accessories to murder ; or if you 're against the mosque at Ground Zero you much hate Muslims ; or if you 're against an open border , you must hate Latinos ; or if you 're against President Obama 's spending policies , you 're probably a racist . You and I worked with these liberal elites and I can tell you that they not only think they are smarter than those " hicks and hates " in quotation marks who live between Manhattan and Malibu , they think they are better . They think they are more decent . The snobbery , the disgusting snobbery is in their DNA . So Mr. President , how do you think you 're going to bridge that gap ? Now if liberals wanted to be introspective , if they want to start to deal with their very destructive superiority complex , if they want to deal with their visceral hatred of conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil conversation . If they do n't , we wo n't -- O'REILLY : What about -- @!GOLDBERG : -- because we 're not turning the other cheek . O'REILLY : -- what about the right-wing people who viscerally hate the left ? Who always take the conservative view point and that if you do n't adhere to what they believe , then you 're inferior , as well . Does n't it cut both ways ? @!GOLDBERG : Well , to some extent ; but not this week it does n't . The people who were linked to -- to be accessories to mass murder , they had nothing to do with this . O'REILLY : Right and they were all conservatives . And the conservative forces did n't do -- @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY : -- what the liberals did . @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY : There is no doubt about it . @!GOLDBERG : But -- but to the -- to the extent that there are people on the right and there are , who if Barack Obama came up with a cure for cancer they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , I have been and I remain totally against those ideologues . O'REILLY : Ok . President Obama gets out there and he has to know that it 's his crew that ignited this firestorm this week . @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY : He 's got to know that . @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY : All right . " New York Times , " MSNBC , Daily Coast which he visited and I chastised him for it . That crew is 100 percent responsible for President Obama 's speech last night . Yet he did not -- @!GOLDBERG : Right . O'REILLY : -- he did not come down and say that . @!GOLDBERG : Right . I understand why he did n't . If he did -- two things : one , he would have created even more polarization which is something we do n't need right now with this progressive left . But you know what , Bill , if he had -- if he had said this week , this week -- the people on -- on my team , the -- the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that would have been his Sister Souljah moment . And I might have even voted for him in 2012 -- O'REILLY : Well , I think that would -- but it would have been a very calculated risk for him to do that because he would have alienated the vigor of the newspapers -- @!GOLDBERG : But -- he could not -- O'REILLY : -- and -- and the networks that have supported him . @!GOLDBERG : He could not have done that . I -- I -- I do not fault him for not doing that . I think it would have been wonderful if he did . But when you just said the vigor of a newspapers , here is one of them . The " New York Times " editorial today , that 's praising the President for telling ideologues to stay -- to stop vilifying their opponents . How clueless are these people ? This is the newspaper that vilifies -- O'REILLY : That started this . @!GOLDBERG : -- its opponents all the time . O'REILLY : Well , they started this controversy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , he is right . And then they attack Sarah Palin in the same editorial . @!GOLDBERG : In the set today . O'REILLY : Right , right . It 's well , what are you going to do ? All right , Bernie thanks very much . Next on " The Rundown " , Laura Ingraham steps up about the President 's speech last night . And later , Megyn Kelly on why the police took no action against the killer Jared Loughner even though information was available -- up coming . O'REILLY : Review from " The Ingraham Angle " segment tonight . Let 's bring in Miss Laura who is in Washington this evening . So what grade would you give President Obama 's speech last night ? @!LAURA-INGRAHAM-FO : Bill , I -- I -- love you . I -- I really do but I think grading the President 's speech when we have six people dead , a little girl , a federal judge and this woman still fighting for her life , I just -- I think that 's exactly kind of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've -- I 'm reading all these blogs that says , " Why the President 's Tucson speech was his greatest ? " News story in ABC or Reuters , " Tucson speech offers fresh start for Obama , new momentum for the President after his -- after his speech " . I -- I 'm really uncomfortable with that . And -- and on a piece of paper if you read the speech , I guess I 'd force -- would be forced to answer I guess it 's kind of a " B " . What I think is the most relevant thing is what 's happening to our country . And as you pointed out and I think very well , for the past several days we have had an attempt by many who were friends and boosters of the President to vilify , demean and denigrate patriotic Americans , good people , and connect them to the acts of a deranged man and circumscribe their political speech as a result . I found that appalling and outrageous . And I believe the President could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ok -- @!INGRAHAM : -- to push back against those people . @!INGRAHAM : I do n't think he did it . O'REILLY : -- because all the polls -- all the polls agree with you and they agree with me . All right . All of them , all right . Most Americans see -- see this for what it is which is why the President had to actually put it into a speech that was primarily memorializing the dead people . @!INGRAHAM : Yes he had some great moments in the speech . I would agree . O'REILLY : Ok. @!INGRAHAM : I think he had a couple of the lines were very moving . O'REILLY : But no , but that 's my next question to you . What -- what would you have liked to have heard from the President that could have made the speech an " A " from a " B " ? @!INGRAHAM : Well , again , I think -- I think the solemnity of the moment for the loss of any life -- I mean , is -- is required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you ca n't control everything but the White House can control a lot when they come into a venue . And when you have T-shirts printed up and dropped on seats , when you have the president of the university introducing him like it 's the kickoff of the 2012 campaign in Iowa , I think -- it 's weird . O'REILLY : Everybody pointed out that the kids were inappropriate and the college did n't quite understand what the event was . @!INGRAHAM : You know they could have done Bill ? O'REILLY : What ? @!INGRAHAM : Bill , either you want -- you want to know it 's been , you know what the President could have done and a caller into my radio show said this today , a very great point he made , a guy from Atlanta I think . He said , " Laura , one word from the President would have helped . When the audience started whooping and hollering and going " Go Obama " , that he could have said , please . And just said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , right ? O'REILLY : Ok. @!INGRAHAM : And people would have stopped right there . O'REILLY : No listen , ok. @!INGRAHAM : I found that -- I found it very -- I found it uncomfortable . O'REILLY : It was disconcerting , it was disconcerting to hear the pep rally . @!INGRAHAM : Yes it was a campaign rally . Nobody on Fox will say that but I 'll say it . It was a campaign event even if the speech itself parts of it , I -- I agree . It 's quite moving and very good . O'REILLY : But I do n't think Obama -- I do n't think Obama and his folks had anything to do with that . I think of it like that . @!INGRAHAM : Then why is he -- why is he -- but Bill , if not , why on earth is he using the deaths of six Americans to call for more civility in politics when he himself said there was n't a single act of incivility that could be traced to the event . What -- what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'REILLY : Well , wait , wait , wait , if I 'm the President of United States and I see what 's unfolded in this week , the horror of not only the assassinations and the Congresswoman you know fighting for her life , I see the American media on the left almost a hundred percent . @!INGRAHAM : Do you think he was talking to the left ? Really , Bill ? O'REILLY : I do . I think he -- @!INGRAHAM : Really ? O'REILLY : -- yes , I do n't know , I think he was talking to the left . @!INGRAHAM : Ok . O'REILLY : But I ca n't read his mind . @!INGRAHAM : Bill -- O'REILLY : But how could he not talk to the left ? @!INGRAHAM : -- it 's a little convenient after the -- the last two years where we 've had his supporters and people in his shop clearly give the green light to the vilification of Tea Party Movement , their brown shirts , their astro turfers , their vitriolic , all the comments they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!INGRAHAM : -- about talk radio , they 've let it slide on this stuff . And now when they are back on the heels . O'REILLY : Well , maybe they are seeing the light here . Look -- @!INGRAHAM : Bill -- they 're back on their heels and were ready to start the 2012 campaign . O'REILLY : -- ok , I know you do n't -- I know you 're a little cynical here -- I know , look , I know you 're a little cynical there . @!INGRAHAM : I know you 're about to interview him but I do n't buy it . O'REILLY : All right , and my interview with President Obama has nothing to do with my commentary , zero . So get off that . @!INGRAHAM : Well , I do n't -- I do n't -- O'REILLY : Get off that . @!INGRAHAM : I know you are about to interview him and I -- and I would like him to address all of the vitriol on the left that you 've documented on this show for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- we will basically have an interview that 's just like the last one , no spin . But let me tell you this , this week , I know liberals this week who said , you know , I finally get it . I finally see it . You presented your case beyond a reasonable doubt , you presented the clips. @!INGRAHAM : They -- O'REILLY : You presented what they said -- @!INGRAHAM : Yes . O'REILLY : -- there is no two sides to the story . Some people -- some people . @!INGRAHAM : Bill , they were trashing Boehner last night . O'REILLY : Some people -- @!INGRAHAM : Bill they were trashing John Boehner last night implying -- O'REILLY : Who is they ? @!INGRAHAM : -- that frankly he 's a heartless -- you know what , people on an opposing cable network . O'REILLY : Ok , but that 's hopeless . @!INGRAHAM : Ok . O'REILLY : And then you are in -- you 're into a scenario then when you -- @!INGRAHAM : Bill , the campaign has begun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this . Let me just ask you this . @!INGRAHAM : And it 's convenient for him now after all these -- all these months of the vilification of the people . O'REILLY : All right , are you saying and I want to be very clear about this . @!INGRAHAM : Yes . O'REILLY : Are you saying that Barack Obama went in there and gave this speech and was insincere ? @!INGRAHAM : I think he knew that there was a political element to the speech . I think he truly , as all of us do , feel terrible and awful about what happened . I would never question that . But when you walk in to a place like that , the White House understood that there were going to be lines that we 're going to be interpreted as applause lines . We have a dead girl on our hands and five other Americans -- O'REILLY : No , I agree with you that he should have put up his hand and said no more of that . @!INGRAHAM : Enough . O'REILLY : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . I agree he should have done that . @!INGRAHAM : I think the country is in trouble . It 's not the rhetoric that 's the problem it 's the policies that are the problem that 's what I think we need to address . O'REILLY : Provocative as always . Directly ahead calls for Congressman Peter King not to investigate American Muslims in light of the Arizona killings . And then , the Culture Warriors on why Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann have avoided the national media this week . Coming right back with those reports . ' 
##4082557 @ ! REP-JEB-HENSARLING : Is there a textbook on how to deal with this ? No . But I think next week it is time for the people 's house to get about the people 's business . @!REP-MARSHA-BLACKBU : I think the American people expect to us get back to work next week . @!BAIER : Well , the word came today that Republicans are moving forward with the effort to repeal the president 's healthcare law . A vote will be next week . A notice came out of the majority leader Eric Cantor 's office saying essentially a vote will happen . This is as Republicans boarded buses for a three-day retreat to Baltimore 's Inner Harbor , a Republican retreat for congressman talking about legislative agenda going forward . This is of course after the president 's big speech in Tucson last night . Analysis of all of this , let 's bring in our panel , Jonah Goldberg , at-large editor of " National Review " online , Juan Williams , FOX News contributor , and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer . Jonah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the Republicans are exactly right to be doing it . You ca n't put your entire agenda on hold indefinitely . And in many ways I think this will be a real test , whether or not we hear a lot from the White House about how we can disagree and not be disagreeable . This is a serious disagreement , and we 'll see how disagreeable it makes the opposition . @!BAIER : Juan , smart move ? @!JUAN-WILLIAMS-FOX : I thought it was really tactful to have it delayed . Some people thought there was no need for the delay but I thought it was appropriate . I think the country is appreciate of Boehner 's leadership in this regard that he took that initiative , despite the fact some say do n't hold back . But I think the key point to be made here is that there is no reason for us to limit discourse or disagreement in the country . I have questions about the efficacy . Why are they doing it ? Because it 's not going to go anywhere , the repeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , go right ahead . @!BAIER : Charles , there are Democrats out there saying it 's the wrong time to bring up this , the first bill , but Republicans are saying when is the right time ? @!GOLDBERG : This is absurd . It is a kind of a way to exploit what just happened . Congress has to act . It gave it a week of delay , I think as a sign of respect . There 's no way we 'll halt the business of the House because of the acts of a madman in Tucson . I think there is subtle effect here . It happened with the attempted Reagan assassination , there is no way in which this is not going to help . Without any cynicism , it 's not going to help the party that is involved the way it helped Reagan . Nobody will deny he was helped politically by the way he acted and conducted himself . And I think it will rebound on the Democrats . Also in a way it puts a pall on proceedings , people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , remember , were the ones who won the election they had the wind at their backs and they have an aggressive agenda . They want to take down all the entire structure of that social democratic liberal agenda that Obama established in the first two years . That 's healthcare , financial reform , and what 's left of the stimulus , and that means attacking it and taking it down . I 'm not even sure if those words are allowed anymore . But in an atmosphere where everybody is free on tiptoes , it 's hard if you are the opposition , starting out and have a mandate to go after and essentially destroy what had been with the other side in legislation over the last two years . @!BAIER : Yet they 're determined to do just that . There has been a lot of fallout from the president 's speech in Tucson , a lot of reaction to the coverage of it . As you take a look at pictures here , we can tell you that the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally aspect , the tone of the event last night ? That was a question from Mark Goler of CBS . And Gibbs responded that they did n't think there would be a lot of applause lines if any in the speech . So basically they were caught off-guard . There was another reaction to the media coverage , including the FOX all-stars analysis of the speech from another famous person . Take a listen . @ ! RUSH-LIMBAUGH-RAD : They were slobbering over it for predictable reasons . It was smart , it was articulate , it was oratorical , it was all the things the educated ruling class wants their members to be and sound like . @!BAIER : " They were slobbering all over it . " Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : As one of the three slobberers here on the set , let me say I find it interesting that only the ruling class wants a president who is smart , articulate , or oratorical , and delivering funeral oration . It 's an odd and rather condescending view of what the rest of America is looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone of a memorial service that at times did sound very raucous with the cheers ? Gibbs said the president was n't prepared for it but obviously rode the wave . What about that ? @!WILLIAMS : I guess the thought is this reminds people of what happened in Minnesota many years ago when a senator died and it seemed to be an overly pompous and sort of celebratory tone -- @!BAIER : The Wellstone event . @!WILLIAMS : Paul Wellstone , yes , and actually sunk the Democrat in the race , which was Mondale and saw Norm Coleman coast to a surprise victory . But here I think there is a mistake made to draw the analogy too closely . The mistake is this . There were people inside the building thrilled to have the president there . They wanted almost in the way you think of it , second line in New Orleans that had some sense of emotional release . I think that is the reason that you saw so many people just going to signal . We appreciate you being here . By the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panel last night . I watched and I thought this was as honest reaction . I do n't know what Limbaugh wants , but that was pretty plain . I do n't think it was very different actually than anywhere else . @!GOLDBERG : Well , first of all , I 'm just ashamed to be on the same table with a sellout like Charles here . Your invitation to the next White House dinner is in the mail , I 'm sure . I agree with Charles about the merits of the speech . Obama did a great job , a great speech . It was the best speech of his presidency in many ways the most presidential thing he has done since he was state senator in Chicago when he gave the 2004 Democratic Convention speech . That said , I thought the tenor out of the audience , which I do n't blame on Obama at all , but I blame it on the president of the university who sounded like let 's give it up for the next speaker every time he went up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a murdered nine-year-old girl was off-putting . Whoever did it in advance and gave out t-shirts and flyers to make it seem like it was a rally , they did a disservice to the president of the United States and a disservice to that school . @!BAIER : But for all the folks out there who are saying that the White House orchestrated a campaign like event , that 's not fair . @!GOLDBERG : I do n't blame it on Obama . I do n't . The school organizers , whoever organized it , at some point -- the only criticism I have for Obama in that speech , which I thought was an excellent speech and again I thought he did a fine job , is that at some point he could have said , or the president university better yet could have said let 's hold our applause or restrain this . This is a solemn occasion , or something along those lines . Instead , it sat on itself and it got out of hand . @!BAIER : Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BAIER : President Obama ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : He was ill-at-ease by the applause . He had his eyes down , and clearly he was uncomfortable , but clearly he did n't have a crowd he could control . At the beginning , as you said , the cheering when the names of the dead was invoked was disconcerting . But the president when he reached the second half of the speech , which was inspirational , was able I think rather skillfully to bring in the enthusiasm of the crowd in the name of something that was positive . In the second half it worked , but I would n't blame him for any of that odd atmosphere . If I could add a word to make sure I 'm not misunderstood in what I said earlier . I was saying that when Reagan was , there was an attempt on Reagan -- it was a natural empathy for him and his agenda . It was unconscious in the same way I think the Democrats will politically have a slight advantage as a result when the issues for which the Congresswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an unconscious pulling back perhaps by those on the attack out of the respect and sympathy for her . @!BAIER : What did you think of the president 's speech and the event ? Give him a grade , five the event a grade in the online poll at **25;27;TOOLONG . Next up , foreclosures and the economy . @ ! DOLLY-LENZ-PRUDEN : Oh , I believe we will see more foreclosures and I think personally 2011 will be the greatest foreclosure year and will surpass 2010 . Even though that seems almost impossible , I believe it will surpass 2010. @!RICK-SHARGA-REALT : There is an overhang of 700,000 bank properties that are not yet on the market . @!GERRI-WILLIS-FOX- : Consider that the unsold market right now is over four million . That is way more than an entire year 's worth of inventory out there . So we 've got a lot to go before this housing crisis gets better . @!BAIER : Foreclosures -- staggering , almost 2.9 million in 2010 . That is up two percent from 2009 , up 23 percent from 2008 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bigger year for foreclosures . What about this and the economy ? We 're back with the panel . Jonah , what does this tell us about what is ahead ? @!GOLDBERG : It tells us 2011 will be a very rough year , because the only way you get through this is to get the unemployment rate down , and one of the ways to get the unemployment rate down is get the housing rate back . There is a nasty catch-22 to it . And at the end of the day , the only way to get through this is you just have to purge out bad properties , bad mortgages and all of the rest . One of the reasons why next year is going to be worse than this , worse in 2010 is because of the freeze in all of the foreclosures that we had because of the robo-calling scandal and all the rest . They 're going to be pushed to 2011 . We have to get the poison out of the system . @!BAIER : Juan , banks are holding a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market yet . @!WILLIAMS : Some of it is still in legal tangle because the courts have to make a decision on what is legally held and what is not legally held . But Jonah is right . You have to clear out distressed inventory and move forward . The trick here is as you move forward to have consumers and the banks find some semblance of balance . If the banks believe in the consumer 's ability to pay and set reasonable terms for mortgages and for equity loan and that the consumers have the capacity to pay . The people that I hold so guilty in all of this , the rating agencies , actually perform their function . @!BAIER : So the calls that we saw before the election , largely we predicted tide to the election for foreclosures to continue to be frozen and for the effort to stop foreclosures , they 'll come to an end ? @!WILLIAMS : No . That has stopped . You know , that was a response by the way from the administration to conservative calls to say this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference in the market and it will slow our economic recovery . @!BAIER : Charles ? @!KRAUTHAMMER : Look , it is an ironic and sad fact that the lower the prices go , the sooner they hit bottom and the sooner the market will clear , the sooner they 'll be able to rebuild . The administration out of a hue main impulse had project called HAMP to help those who were going to lose their houses but unfortunately it 's not been successful . The projections in midyear were that three out of every four people who were on this HAMP assistance would end up losing to the house anyway . And it 's a way of slowing down the market . I think the boil has to be lanced . It is going to happen in 2011 and I think it will allow a recovery afterwards . But if you are losing the house and the family is going to suffer , no consolation economically it 's necessary . @!BAIER : Especially because so many Americans put their value , their wealth in their home . @!GOLDBERG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is an argument that housing is still overvalued . To get to politics of this , it does tee up nicely for the Republicans a series of important hearing on reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are essentially insolvent if it were n't for the $150 bailout and they have $5 trillion of mortgages on their books . Their common shares of stock dropped 99 percent in value , and that was a direct result of policies , at least I would argue that came over the last few years led by Democrats . That argument needs to be had and has n't happened in a proper way yet . @!BAIER : Congressman Issa will lead one investigation into that . That 's it for the panel but stay tuned for something we cringe at in this business . @!BAIER : Finally tonight we try to write cleverly , tightly , succinctly . Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not . For some reason a big snowstorm really brings out the worst . @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : And here we snow again . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Say it ai n't snow . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Say it ai n't snow . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : There is no business like snow business . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : There is no business like snow business . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Snow biz . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Snow doubt about it . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Going snow-where fast . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Oh snow , snow way ! @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Ice , ice , baby . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Snow , my god . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Snow joke , get it ? Our producer was very proud of that line , so I felt like I had to say it . It 's snow joke . @!BAIER : One word -- painful . Thanks for inviting us into our home tonight . That is it for this " Special Report , " fair , balanced , and unafraid. ' 
##4082563 GUY @!RAZ , host : From NPR News , this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED . I 'm Guy Raz . A new decade inevitably prompts reflection : who we are as a nation now and where we 're headed toward in the future . And so in recent days , a series of articles , speeches and even news stories have resurrected the question of whether America 's preeminent role in the world is in decline . And if so , who might fill it ? That 's our cover story today . The answer to the question is quite often China . And in a recent poll taken by CNN , nearly 60 percent of Americans said they regard China 's wealth and economic power as a threat . And that anxiety seemed to fuel some of the news coverage this week when video surfaced of a test flight of a prototype Chinese stealth fighter . Unidentified Woman 1 : China 's military showing off its new stealth fighter jet . Unidentified Woman 2 : Known as the J-20 , a rare glimpse of the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened while Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is in China . Unidentified Woman 3 : China , in a show of military bravado , has staged its first test flight of a stealth fighter jet . @!RAZ : Now , there is no doubt that China is an emerging power . Its military budget has increased three-fold over the past decade , and its economy is now the third largest in the world . And those topics and others will be front and center when Chinese President Hu Jintao arrives to Washington Tuesday on a state visit . But let 's , for a moment , unpack those seemingly impressive numbers . The U.S. still spends more on defense than every other country in the world combined . China is planning to build an aircraft carrier ; the U.S. has 11 . And as for stealth fighters , well , China has a prototype ; the U.S. has many dozens in operation as we speak . And in both nominal and per capita terms , the U.S. economy still dwarfs China 's . And so perhaps in a bid to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the issue yesterday . Secretary HILLARY CLINTON ( Department of State ) : This is a critical juncture , yes , but I would say to my fellow Americans , this is not a time to fear for the future . @!RAZ : Now , as I mentioned earlier , there are conflicting viewpoints about America 's position in the world and China 's rise . In a moment , we 'll hear from someone who says stop panicking . But first to Gideon Rachman , whose forthcoming book is called " Zero-Sum Future . " He 's written this month 's cover story in Foreign Policy magazine and it 's called " America 's Decline : This Time It 's For Real . " @!Mr-GIDEON-RACHMAN- : American Power in an Age of Anxiety " ) : Its relative decline . I mean , I think that what we 're talking about , in my mind , is the transition from a period between the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the financial crisis in 2008 when America had its unipolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American military power , but also American ideas seemed all-powerful . The ideas of democracy , free markets , et cetera . So that we even thought that globalization was a form of Americanization . I think in the aftermath of the financial crisis , it 's become clear that we 're going back to a world in which , although America will remain a preeminent power probably for a while yet , it has competitors again . @!RAZ : And you predict that as a result of this , that the relationship between China and the U.S. will actually get worse in the next year . @!Mr-RACHMAN : Yeah , I think things are going to get a bit bumpy over the next five years and more . I mean , I think the reason is that both sides are reassessing the relationship in ways that make it a little more adversarial . I think for the United States , the assumption that the Chinese economic relationship was equally beneficial to the U.S. , clearly , that 's coming under challenge in Congress and elsewhere . But I think also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , our time is coming and that it may be a bit time for us to be a little more assertive . The China-U.S. relationship has always had elements of friendship and cooperation and rivalry . And I think the rivalrous elements are becoming more emphasized now . @!RAZ : But it still is a - very much a mutually dependent relationship . China depends on the U.S. market for its products . The U.S. depends on China , of course , for borrowing . The conventional wisdom on that relationship is that if it is managed properly , both sides win . So why is that wrong ? @!Mr-RACHMAN : Well , I think that it 's more complicated than that . I mean , I think that there are win-win elements to the relationship and that 's a phrase the Chinese have picked up from us . You 're constantly told if you go to Beijing or Shanghai , this is a win-win relationship . But I think they say it again and again because they 're worried that we in the West and particularly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are two main ways in which it 's not so win-win . Firstly , I think that this whole question of global economic imbalances and of high unemployment in the West illustrates that globalization is n't an unadulterated win for the United States or for the Europeans simply because we are coping with the loss of a lot of jobs . That 's the economic aspect . I think the political aspect is that a rising power like China , particularly a China that has a very different political system from that of the United States and that has a sense that it has been humiliated in the past , inevitably they are going to be more assertive in ways that we find uncomfortable . @!RAZ : So specifically , what would a more assertive Chinese power do ? @!Mr-RACHMAN : Well , we 'll see , to be honest . I think there 's a debate in China about how they should deploy this power . But I think the Chinese feel that it 's not that they want a direct confrontation with the United States . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid that . I think the way they see it is they gradually grow Chinese power and military capabilities at a time when America is increasingly under financial strain and is cutting back on its military or is thinking of cutting back on its military and that that balance of forces changes over 10 , 20 years and more , which means that they do n't have to have a direct confrontation because people just gradually get used to the new situation . Now , it may not be that smooth or that easy . @!RAZ : As you know , there have long been comparisons between where America is now and where Great Britain was at the end of the 19th century , and I wonder if those comparisons are somewhat hyperbolic. @!Mr-RACHMAN : Yeah . Actually , I would agree with you on that . I mean , I think that the , you know , if you look back at the history of the British Empire , it was pretty remarkable that a country with that very small proportion of the world 's population , a small island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that was clearly less sustainable situation than that of the United States . However , I think where the parallel is interesting is that , I mean , it does suggest that all dominant powers have their period . And then whether through its replacement by another power or by a multipolar system , whether through war or by peaceful means , generally , no power is dominant forever . @!RAZ : That 's Gideon Rachman . He is the chief foreign affairs commentator for the Financial Times and author of the forthcoming book " Zero-Sum Future : American Power in an Age of Anxiety . " Gideon Rachman , thank you so much . @!Mr-RACHMAN : Thank you . @!RAZ : Thomas P.M. Barnett is the chief analyst at Wikistrat and a former Pentagon analyst . He 's just back from China . And it 's fair to say , he 's got a different perspective . @!Mr-THOMAS-P.M-BARN : I think the hype on China right now is really out of control . It 's very similar to the way the British looked at us , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900s . I mean , they imagined we could have bought and sold them . The Chinese could n't do the same with us . Their economy is still a fraction of ours . I always say if you want to understand an America like a China , invite everybody , and I mean everybody in the Western Hemisphere to come live in the continental United States . Would we have rich people ? Lots of them . Would we have a big middle class ? Big middle class . Would we have six , 700 million interior rural poor ? Yes . And that would feel like China . @!RAZ : So you , I mean , so you would concede that China wo n't sort of overtake the United States economically , maybe militarily anytime soon , but that it could conceivably happen in the next 40 or 50 or 60 years . @!Mr-BARNETT : Sure . But that 's going to be a very , very different China . I mean , our expectations about democratization over there , I think , are a little out of whack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The modern China with the real revolution being Deng Xiaoping , in the late ' 70s , early ' 80s , that country is about 30 years old and I look at a situation where you 're going to be talking about the people who 've only grown up in the post-Deng age , coming to power in their 50s in the late 2020s , early 2030s . That 's where I look for China to do the democratization process . And I think if we accept the fact that they just , you know , they 're not going to turn into America on our timetable and stop being so stung that 40 years after Nixon goes to China , they 're still Chinese , I think we can live with them the next 20 years . And actually getting through the next 20 years with them cooperatively , collaboratively is not only a good idea , it 's absolutely essential when you consider a global middle class aspiring to a lifestyle that the planet can not sustain if we use old resource models . @!RAZ : Tom Barnett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year , people start talking about America 's role in the world . And we have been talking a lot about that for the past decade . Let 's , for argument 's sake , say - and I think you can make a pretty compelling argument that America 's preeminent role in the world is coming to an end , its status as a sole superpower . It seems pretty clear that China wo n't necessarily fill that role as a sole superpower but rather become another pole of power along with the U.S. I mean , has n't that already started to happen in a sense ? @!Mr-BARNETT : I would argue , yes , and that it 's a good thing and that the biggest problem in the system right now is our inability to deal with that success . We created an international liberal trade order after the Second World War because we decided after fighting in two world wars , this was the way to get past colonialization , free trade , make the economics lead , democracy will follow . We were usually successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now we call it a global economy , globalization . Everything we sought to have happened has happened . We 've also created a system , first time in history , that allows great powers to rise . So in Asia , you have Korea , Japan , India , China , all rising , all powerful , no real prospect to great power . Or you have Europe - Germany , France , Britain , Russia , no real prospect to great power - there . These are huge successes . First half of the 20th century , that octet and a few others killed a hundred million people . We 've created the system for these people to rise , and now we seem uncomfortable with the fact that we 're not going to be the sole pole anymore in the system .

##4082564 SCOTT @!SIMON , host : This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News . I 'm Scott Simon . When Dick Wolf 's original " Law and Order " did n't return for a 21st season on NBC , fans of the show - and I ca n't pretend to be impersonal about this - were bereft . There 's still spin-offs and knock-offs , of course , including the cast shakeup on the new " Law and Order : L.A. " But for the " Law and Order " idea to really work , you need the screech of subways , sausage and falafel carts , and all the great crazy and diverse din and clatter of street life - like in New York . Which is why it 's so good to hear ... @(Soundbite-of-TV-sh) @!Mr-STEVEN-ZIRNKILT : In the criminal justice system , the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups : the police who investigate crime ... qwq @ ( Soundbite-of-TV-sh Unidentified Man : ... and the crown prosecutors who prosecute the offenders . These are their stories . @(Soundbite-of-music) @!SIMON : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week on BBC America . Dick Wolf is the executive producer . And like the original , it has stories ripped from the headlines , wisecracking cops in trench coats walking into the squad room debating the likes of vegetarian sausages . @(Soundbite-of-TV-sh) @!Mr-BRADLEY-WALSH-@ : ( as Ronnie Brooks ) Mattie , what are you talking about ? Sausages are made from meat , not soy . And they certainly ai n't made from vegetables . @!Mr-JAMIE-BAMBER-@1 : ( as Matt Devlin ) Why should veggies be denied the pleasure of the sausage roll ? And let 's face it , Ron , it is half the fat . @!Mr-WALSH : ( as Ronnie Brooks ) And half the taste . I 'll have you know , I 'm at the peak of my fitness . @!SIMON : We 're joined now by the two actors who bring London street smarts to the " Law and Order " franchise , Jamie Bamber , familiar to millions as Captain Apollo in " Battlestar Galactica , " plays Detective Superintendent Matt Devlin in " Law and Order . " He joins us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : My very great pleasure , Scott . @!SIMON : And Bradley Walsh , the comedian , quiz show MC , an now acclaimed dramatic actor , who plays DS Ronnie Brooks . He 's in London . Thank you for being with us. @!Mr-WALSH : Hi , Scott . @!SIMON : So were you conscious of kind of replicating the wise old cop , cute young cop duo that Jerry Orbach and Benjamin Bratt played for so long ? @!Mr-BAMBER : I speak for myself . I have to say I was n't really , because I was ... @!SIMON : You 're the cute one . @!Mr-BAMBER : Oh , am I ? @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!SIMON : Oh , wait . Is that the wrong thing to say , Mr. Walsh ? @!Mr-WALSH : No , no , that 's fine , Scott . He really is the cute one . Do n't worry about that . He 's very wicked . @!Mr-BAMBER : I did try and flip the roles , but they were n't having it . No , I mean I was super-familiar with " Law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States for a while , and just the sort of , you know , that the music , the bum- bums , the - everything about it . But I have to say , I did n't watch religiously . So it was n't something that I was really aware of stepping into someone else 's shoes . You know , I think with these things - and I had the same thing with " Battlestar Galactica " - you do n't want to obsess too much about what worked when someone else did it . You want to try and come at it fresh . Although , you know , I 'm sure we have inherited a lot of , you know , what Jerry Orbach and his partner did originally . And we are indebted to them . But , you know , you try and do your own thing - eh , Brad ? @!Mr-WALSH : Absolutely . Having said that , I mean I did n't know the show . I honestly did n't , so there was nothing I could do other than bring what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me , and how it worked alongside Jamie . So for me it was very unfamiliar territory . @!SIMON : Mr. Walsh , you were once the warm-up act for Tom Jones ? @!Mr-WALSH : Yes , indeed . I was . @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Mr-WALSH : And do you know Shirley Bassey ? Do you know that singer ? @!SIMON : Of course . We had the pleasure of interviewing Dame Shirley not long ago . Yes . @!Mr-WALSH : Well , yeah . Tom Jones , Shirley Bassey , Engelbert Humperdinck , Barry Manilow . So I 've done - when I doing standup comedy , you know , I was there - I was the front man in their concerts . So I did my sort of half an hour . I was doing from a young man , probably packed in about 12 years ago , and then started acting . It just seemed like a good idea at the time . There was nothing else to do . @!Mr-BAMBER : Oh , you have n't packed in , love . He still makes us laugh when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah . @!Mr-WALSH : But it was something I enjoyed . But , you know , time to move on . It 's a young man 's game - standup comedy . @!SIMON : And yet , of course , you 're - the character that you play now , DS Ronnie Brooks is , if anything , he 's the dramatic center . @!Mr-WALSH : Well , I think he 's the wizened old mainstay that 's the sort of good cop , bad cop type guy you need , I guess . He 's seen it all , done it all . He 's come through alcoholism and two marriages . And he needs someone young and vibrant and handsome with him to sort of bounce off . And that 's why Jamie 's there and it 's good . It 's really good . @!SIMON : How do you see your character , Jamie Bamber ? @!Mr-BAMBER : My character is much more of a - he does n't really empathize with victims . He 's sort of idealistic still . He still believes in good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . There 's one episode in particular which confronts his past and you get an insight into who he is . And he 's someone that has n't - he 's been through some tough times , but he does n't view himself as a victim . And therefore he does n't really empathize with those around him that suffered . And that 's very much , you know , a bit that comes to bear in all the cases that we come across . He 's very keen to convict people . And Ronnie is a bit slower and a bit more measured , and he 's lived life . So that 's why they 're a good team . I think they have mutually exclusive energies . And they sort of fit together well . @!SIMON : Mr. Walsh , you were once a pro football player for British football ? @!Mr-WALSH : Yeah , I was what you 'd call a Third Division player . There was the Premier League , the First Division , or the Third Division ... @!Mr-BAMBER : He 's very modest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty hard to do , ' cause there 's a lot of soccer players at home . @!Mr-WALSH : Considering I only have one leg as well . @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Mr-WALSH : That 's the most extraordinary thing , quite frankly . @!SIMON : You are a great actor . @!Mr-BAMBER : Did n't your coach tell you that you were on the team because you kept everyone laughing on the bus or something ? @!Mr-WALSH : Yes , that 's exactly . That is exactly ... @!Mr-BAMBER : That was one of your primary functions . @!Mr-WALSH : After that I packed it in and became an actor , oddly enough , and then there was n't enough work in that and then stand-up comedy . @!Mr-BAMBER : You 've had about five careers , have n't you . @!Mr-WALSH : I have , yes . @!Mr-BAMBER : And made a success of each of them . That 's very impressive . @!Mr-WALSH : Well , I do n't know about that , mate , not such a success of that . But , yeah , you know , sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean and recognizing that the British approach is different from the American method , but does it help when you 've had so many careers when you 're playing a kind of knock-around character like Ronnie Brooks , who - Detective Superintendent Ronnie Brooks , who has seen a lot of life ? @!Mr-WALSH : Do you know what , Scott - it 's not about that , really . I mean I 've , to be honest with you , I 've never had an acting lesson . But I 've been at drama school for 50 years . And what that means is I 'm learning every day . Every person I see has a story to tell . Every day I learn something new , and you know , you go through life 's experiences and if you can bring every experience , at some point somewhere in every drama or every story that you have to portray , you will come across an emotion or a feeling you have had some point in your life . And as long as you can go back to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , then you 're sort of halfway there , and alongside yourself and of the other actor who 's playing opposite you , and the director , you will come up with what would sort of be the emotion that you need , really , and that 's the way I do it . @!SIMON : Mr. Bamber , is it fun to be out and filming on the streets of London ? @!Mr-BAMBER : Oh , yeah . I love it . I love it . @!Mr-WALSH : Yeah . @!Mr-BAMBER : I mean we do n't have the hugest sets . It 's " Law and Order " on a budget the way we do it in the UK , inevitably ; we 're a smaller market . The joy for me is when we get - let loose in the middle of the West End of London . And we do n't have - we have a very small crew and we do n't shut any streets down and we shoot with cameras on shoulders and pedestrians walk by and they , you know , invariably now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the camera and we have to go again . @!Mr-WALSH : Yeah . @!Mr-BAMBER : But we tend to do them in one , you know , whole scenes in one shot . @(Soundbite-of-TV-sh) @!Mr-WALSH : ( as Ronnie Brooks ) So ( unintelligible ) ca n't afford to live in the area anymore ? @!Mr-BAMBER : ( as Matt Devlin ) They move to areas where they can afford it . @!Mr-WALSH : ( as Ronnie Brooks ) What about when that gets gentrified , where do they go then ? @!Mr-BAMBER : ( as Matt Devlin ) So what , we do n't improve these areas ? King 's Cross has always been a dump . Finally it 's improving . And Brad and I get to run off into various little holes in-between , in-between takes and grab a coffee or a nice lunch somewhere . @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Mr-WALSH : Yeah . @!Mr-BAMBER : We 're really putting London front and center as the sort of central character of the show . And , yeah , having also been away from London for a while , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that stuff . I absolutely love that bit and we 've had some really great laughs , have n't we ? @!Mr-WALSH : Oh , yeah ( unintelligible ) yeah . I mean oddly enough , Jay , where I 'm speaking to you from now , Bush House on the Aldwych , is right at the bottom of Kingsway , where we just , we filmed ( unintelligible ) Clements is there , and it 's amazing . @!Mr-BAMBER : There 's barely a street left we have n't done something in , you know , in the West End of London . @!Mr-WALSH : Yeah . @!Mr-BAMBER : And it 's fantastic fun . And Scott Bradley is a very recognizable character at home . Everyone thinks they know ... @!SIMON : Sure . Coronation Street for you ... @!Mr-BAMBER : Exactly . So when we 're on a street corner , invariably a cab will drive by , roll down his window , going , Brad 's son(ph) , how are you ? Whatever it is , and Bradley has an equally vociferous retort to give , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of Americans watching this will recognize the street life of a great city in London , as they did in New York . But they 'll be thrown by the barristers wearing wigs . @!Mr-BAMBER : And rightly . It 's weird . @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Mr-BAMBER : It 's weird . Why ca n't the British get over their traditions ? Yeah , it 's very odd , but that 's what we bring to the party , I suppose . We have our own little eccentricities and color that the British legal system , you know , provides . The barristers are n't allowed to walk around the court either , which poses a real problem for the director and cinematographer in terms of how to bring energy to the scenes , because they are rooted to the spot . And there are little things like that . Also they ca n't , they do n't talk directly to the jury very often . But there are certain , yeah , certain little things about our system that are particular and we have to sort of celebrate them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show worth doing as opposed to just , you know , airing reruns of the original . @!SIMON : Well , gentlemen , thank you both very much . I enjoy your work a lot . It 's a great show . So glad we could talk to you . @!Mr-BAMBER : Thank you . @!Mr-WALSH : Thank you , Scott . Cheers , mate . @!SIMON : Jamie Bamber at NPR West . Bradley Walsh in London . The second season of the " Law and Order : UK " airs Friday nights , 9:00 Eastern and Pacific time , on BBC America . @!Mr-WALSH : Dum-dum. qwq @ ( Soundbite-of-laugh '
