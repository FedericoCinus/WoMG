Could have gone over the next hill and the next and the next . We just did n't . We came back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Not really . @!SPENCER : No ? @!MICHAEL : Scared that my father might get shot . @(Footage-of-safehou) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) After the arrest , the two children are spirited off to this safehouse , a few miles from the isolated piece of land they called home . Officer 2 : This is where they was living at , in this Winnebago , living off the land , I guess . I 'm not sure what they were doing here , trying to stay hid . @(Footage-of-Winneba) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) The only schooling the kids had was at home . Why did n't you go to school ? @!MICHAEL : Because there 's lots of things , more like lots of children doing bad things and stuff . @!SPENCER : In school ? @!MICHAEL : Mm-hmm , and we 'd get influenced . Officer 2 : No electricity . They kept a crate over here in the creek with ... Unidentified Police Officer 3 : Yeah , a milk crate with -- with perishable stuff in s -- in the water there in this little branch . Officer 2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze .

How was the squirrel ? @!MICHAEL : Yum-yum . @(Footage-of-state-p) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Two days after the children are recovered , Florida state prosecutor Lance Day ... @!Ms-GRAY : OK , thank you . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... gently gives Marjorie more details . @!Mr-DAY : From what I 'm told , they -- they literally lived in the woods , and it was a kind of a survivalist-type adventure for them . They gave the little girl a -- a bath last night .

It 'd be very negative for them . @!Ms-GRAY : I -- And I understand that . I really do . I really understand that . They do n't want to see me . They 're afraid of me .

Sometimes she 'd -- she 'd lock us in our room . I remember that . Beat us . She beat us when we did just a little bad thing . She beat us. @(Footage-of-childre) @!Mr-WOOD : Are you guys ready to go ? @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) As they leave Missouri ... @!Mr-WOOD : You 'd be surprised at what things are going to be like . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... the last place the children say they want to go is back to Florida ...

That 's for sure . @(Footage-of-Don-Woo) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Don Wood of Child Watch is convinced that the kids are only repeating what their father has taught them . Right now they consider their mother the enemy ? @!Mr-WOOD : Oh , yeah , no question . She 's still the enemy . @(Footage-of-plane-t) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) The experts say with time and counseling , that will change . @(Footage-of-Marjori) @!Ms-GRAY : Take a deep breath . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Until it does , ironically , it is Marjorie who must hide ... Unidentified Man : You can make out an image right here , but you ca n't really ... @!Ms-GRAY : OK . Man : ... make out who it is. @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... to finally get a glimpse of her children , if only from a distance . @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) I mean , I still do n't believe I 'm going to see them . I still do n't believe it . 
##221651 " IT WILL HAUNT ME " @!DAN-RATHER-host : There is no way to predict what the days ahead will bring for Marjorie and her children , but there may be lessons in the stories of other families reunited after years apart . Richard Schlesinger reports on coming to terms after coming home . @(Photo-of-Carolyn-S) @!Ms-CAROLYN-SMITH-@ : @(Voiceover) Christopher was four and Charles was six . It 's just so weird , I mean , because you remember them being little . @(Footage-of-Carolyn) @!Ms-SMITH : @(Voiceover) And then it 's like you open your eyes and they 're big , and there they are . @(Footage-of-Carolyn) @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE : @(Voiceover) When Carolyn Smith was reunited with her children in Houston after seven years , it was almost like meeting strangers . @!Ms-SMITH : I said , ' They 're so big . ' @!CHARLES-SMITH : I did n't really recognize her . Eventually I recognized her when she told me. @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : Charles asked her who she was , and she said , ' I 'm your mother , ' but I did n't say anything the whole way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person ? @!CHARLES-SMITH : No. @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : None . @!CHARLES-SMITH : I saw her as the enemy . I saw everybody around me as the enemy . @(Photos-of-Charles-) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) Charles and Chris Smith were snatched by their father as preschoolers . When they came back to their mother , they were adolescents . @!CHARLES-SMITH : We had our own secret codes , OK ? @!SCHLESINGER : What would you use the codes for ? @!CHARLES-SMITH : Do n't talk to her . Do n't -- you know , do n't accept anything . @!CHRISTOPHER : Do n't take this . @!CHARLES-SMITH : Yeah . @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : Do n't do that . @!Ms-SMITH : What is this ? These are not my kids . And they were so fake and they were so artificial . @!Mr-ERNIE-ALAN-@1Na : When the child is found , there tends to be an attitude of relief and ' happy ever after . ' But the reality is the recovery of the child is only the beginning . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Alan ; -s @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) Ernie Alan is head of the National Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith and Marjorie Chappell Gray are up against . @!Mr-ALAN : @(Voiceover) The abducting parent has fed them , clothed them , been their protector . Has , in -- in many ways , in a lot of these cases , brainwashed the child . @!SCHLESINGER : Well , what did he tell you about your mother ? @!CHARLES-SMITH : That she was , like , bad -- you know , took drugs and crap -- and you know , not a good person . That 's what he said . @!SCHLESINGER : Did you believe that ? @!CHARLES-SMITH : Yeah . @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : Yes , because I did n't remember her as she was . @(Footage-of-Schlesi) @!JASON-TOMASSI : I -- I could n't remember I had a mom , so I did n't know . @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) It had been 11 years since Jason Tomassi and his brother David had seen their mother , Emily Rateau. @!Ms-EMILY-RATEAU-@1 : And when I saw Jason -- he was the first one I saw , and I just went up to him and hugged him and cried . And that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!J-TOMASSI : And she kind of just came in and gave me a hug and I was like , you know , ' Who the hell are you ? ' You know ? @(Photo-of-Jason-and) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) They were taken by their father not once , but twice . The first time he took them for three and a half years . @!Ms-RATEAU : There were n't any laws against it . It was just considered a dom -- a domestic dispute . @(Video-of-Jason-and) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) After the boys were found , a judge allowed David Tomassi to continue seeing the boys . And nine months later he took them again , this time for 11 years . @!Mr-ALAN : I think it 's difficult to conclude anything other than their childhoods were stolen from them and from their mother . @(Footage-of-Rateau) @!Mr-ALAN : Voiceover ) How do you give that back ? @!Ms-RATEAU : Jason , you want milk , coffee ? qwq @ ( Footage-of-Rateau , @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) David and Jason have been living with their mother in South Bend , Indiana , for just 10 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second batch . @!J-TOMASSI : My mom 's a nice lady and all . She tries . You know , she loves us. @!DAVID-TOMASSI : My mom makes me feel real at home , you know . She 's doing a real good job of making me feel , you know , like I 'm her son , so it 's kind of nice . @!SCHLESINGER : See , I get this sense that you 're really not that comfortable here . Is that right ? @!D-TOMASSI : Sometimes I am , but sometimes I 'm not . @!SCHLESINGER : Do you feel still close to your dad ? @!J-TOMASSI : Yeah . @!SCHLESINGER : Is it fair to ask if you feel closer to your dad than you do to your mom ? @!J-TOMASSI : Yeah . I mean , I 'll alway -- I 'll always love my dad more than my mom . There 's no question . @!D-TOMASSI : I do n't know anymore . I used to think I was closer to my dad . Now I just -- I 'm not close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go my own separate way . @(Footage-of-Schlesi) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) Coming home means having to reconcile two versions of the same events . What do you want to ask them ? @!J-TOMASSI : Like , find out the truth , like , why he left with us . And , like , everybody 's got their own different views about it . And so I still do n't know , you know . I 'd want the honest , honest , honest , honest , honest truth . @!SCHLESINGER : Mm-hmm . @(Footage-of-David-T) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) David Tomassi , who twice took his boys , was released from jail after serving 10 months for the 11 years he hid them . Do you want to go see your kids again ? Mr. @!DAVID-TOMASSI : Do I want to ? Yeah . I 'd love to my see my boys , but I -- I ca n't see them right now . @!Ms-RATEAU : He gets 10 months in jail . That 's the maximum penalty , which I think is absolutely ridiculous . @(Footage-of-David-T) @!J-TOMASSI : @(Voiceover) It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was a kid , what me and my dad have gone through , you know . So it was like the bond between us is -- you ca n't match it , you know . @!SCHLESINGER : No matter what ? @!J-TOMASSI : No , no matter what . @!SCHLESINGER : Are you guys at all angry at your father for putting you through this ? @!D-TOMASSI : Deep down inside , I am a little bit . @!SCHLESINGER : How deep ? @!D-TOMASSI : Real deep down . @!SCHLESINGER : How do you know that ? What 's that feel like ? @!D-TOMASSI : I do n't know . I just look at other kids and they 're all normal , and I just look at myself as like -- sometimes I think I 'm like a freak or something . Sometimes it hurts , but I just try to ignore it . I try and do the best I can . @(Footage-of-the-Tom) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) The experts say time may not heal , but it can help . How old were you when you came back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : Eleven . @(Footage-of-the-Smi) @!SCHLESINGER : @(Voiceover) Charles and Chris Smith have been home for three and a half years , much longer than David and Jason Tomassi . Over time the Smith boys have settled in to life with their mother . @(Footage-of-the-Smi) @!Ms-SMITH : Did you get that side wet ? @!SCHLESINGER : Are you guys happy now ? @!CHRISTOPHER-SMITH : Yes . @!CHARLES-SMITH : I feel happy . @!SCHLESINGER : I 'm -- I 'm looking at you . And I 'm listening to you and -- and you still strike me as an angry guy . Are you -- are you still angry about all this ? @!CHARLES-SMITH : Maybe deep down inside . I mean , even my mom kind of brings it up to me . But I do n't re -- I 'm not really conscious about it , you know . But maybe deep down inside . @!SCHLESINGER : I mean , look how -- look how tight you stand . Look how -- look how controlled you are . Look -- look at your body language . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CHARLES-SMITH : Well , I do n't -- I do n't say that it 's necessarily over . I mean , we 're living a normal life and all . But as far as my past , I do my best not to live in it , but somehow I have this feeling that it 's going to haunt me for the rest of my life . You know , somewhere along the line , it 's going to haunt me. @!RATHER : In a moment , an update on Marjorie Chappell Gray and her children , so stay with us.

I did n't even , you know -- for a -- for a whole year I used my same name , and then I decided I wanted to change my name and have a new start . @(Photo-of-Marjorie-) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) But he says the reason he took off with the kids is obvious : Marjorie was sexually abusing them . @!Mr-GRAY : You do n't want to believe something like that . @!SPENCER : Now this is after Marjorie has been awarded custody ? @!Mr-GRAY : That 's correct . @!Mr-HARRY-KROP-@1Cl : He indicated to me that he had concerns that his children were being or were sexually abused by the mother . I believe it was around May 8th of 1990. @(Footage-of-Krop-an) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) It was a visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , that triggered Dennis Gray 's flight . @!Mr-KROP : Initially , I saw the father alone and got his history . @(Footage-of-dolls) @!Mr-KROP : @(Voiceover) Then I spoke to each child independently . @!Mr-GRAY : After quite a long time with the children , he came and said that he believed that they had been sexually molested. @!Mr-KROP : My conclusions were that I could not conclude that sexual abuse had occurred , but that there was reason to be concerned . I referred the children for further counseling . @!SPENCER : So , in a nutshell , then , you basically just said , ' I think this should be further investigated . ' @!Mr-KROP : Exactly . @!SPENCER : ' I do n't know ' ? @!Mr-KROP : Exactly . There are cases where that 's the best professional opinion that we could give is , ' I do n't know . ' @!SPENCER : Dennis Gray took ' I do n't know ' to mean ... @!Mr-KROP : Apparently . @!SPENCER : ... ' I 'm going to take these kids . ' @!Mr-KROP : Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Ms-MIA-HEINEY-@1Co : I 'd say that maybe as many as a dozen people had interviewed these children . There was never any evidence that I saw of any abuse by Marjorie Gray . @(Footage-of-Heiney-) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Mia Heiney was the court-appointed guardian for the Gray children . Why do people bring up charges of sexual abuse if they 're just -- What ? -- are they just making them up ? @!Ms-HEINEY : I think it 's a very intense emotional situation that people are in during custody battles and that people in desperate situations do desperate things . @!SPENCER : Did you think it was in their best interest ? @!Mr-GRAY : Of course I did or I would n't have done it . @(Footage-of-Gray-an) @!Ms-HEINEY : @(Voiceover) I just feel that that was just a ploy that was used to try to gain custody of the children . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Ultimately , a jury will decide if Gray acted out of real concern or simply out of vengeance . But even if found guilty , he probably wo n't do much time . @!Mr-DAY : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But because of Florida 's sentencing guidelines ... @!Mr-DAY : The guidelines will probably come out somewhere between zero and 22 months . @!SPENCER : Twenty-two months ? @(Video-of-Gray-in-j) @!Mr-DAY : @(Voiceover) Yes . That does n't mean that they do 22 months . You still have the overcrowding in Florida 's prisons to deal with . So you 're sentenced to 22 months , you may do nine months . @!SPENCER : At some point Dennis Gray gets out of jail . @!Ms-MARJORIE-CHAPPE : Right . @!SPENCER : What are you most worried about ? @!Ms-GRAY : A rekidnapping. @!SPENCER : Really ? You think they would try this again ? @!Ms-GRAY : I 'm afraid that they would . Why not ? @!Ms-HEINEY : I think that the Gray family aided and abetted their s -- Mr. Gray , Dennis Gray , in absconding with these children . @!SPENCER : She 's not exaggerating ? @!Ms-HEINEY : I do n't believe so . I think that they would assist him again in absconding with these children . @!Ms-GRAY : I think I should have a safe life with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am now . @(Footage-of-Dennis-) @!Ms-GRAY : But I 'm thinking it 's not going to end . @!SPENCER : She 's worried for her safety . Should she be ? @!Mr-GRAY : No . Oh , it 's ... @!SPENCER : Why are you laughing ? @!Mr-GRAY : It 's comical . I ... @!SPENCER : She should n't be afraid ? @!Mr-GRAY : No , that 's bull . That 's just baloney. @!SPENCER : Do you think that just as you were justified the first time to take them , it would be justifiable to take them again ? @!Mr-GRAY : I would say to most anybody out there that moving away like I did would have to be the last thing you would ever do . It would have to be a very special situation . I had to sacrifice everything in my life . I gave up a career , family , friends , possessions , whatever most people think , you know , are important . @!SPENCER : So does that mean that you would n't do it again ? Or that you would ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that . @(Footage-of-the-chi) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) But you believe Dennis Gray loves these children ? @!Mr-DON-WOOD-@1Chil : Oh , there 's no question . As a father , he 's loves his children . It 's misguided love , but it 's -- it 's definitely love . @(Photo-of-Dennis-an) @!Mr-WOOD : @(Voiceover) I mean , could you still love a child and hurt a child , and that 's what he did . @(Footage-of-Michael) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) What would you like to say to the kids ? @!Mr-GRAY : I know they would never see this , but if they did , you know , I would tell them that I love them and , ' You know that I love you and I 'll never abandon you . You can believe that . And I 'll do everything in my power to protect you . ' @!DAN-RATHER-@1Host@ : Just ahead , the day the children 's mother has been waiting for finally arrives . @(Footage-of-car-arr) @!Mr-WOOD : @(Voiceover) There she is. @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) It 's like having a baby again .

It -- you know , things that we take for granted seem to be major events to them . You know , they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Nancy had said to my daughter last night about how comfortable this bed was , and saying that , ' We usually sleep on wood .

What 's your favorite meat , Nancy ? Turkey ? @!NANCY : Everything . @!Mr-WOOD : Everything . Roast beef ? @(Voiceover) I do n't think they 've had a lot of food around . I love roast beef , too . Usually the job ends when they go home , where this is a little different . We 're almost having to now -- we 've found them , now we 've got to build a bridge to take them home . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) The journey home could take weeks . @!Mr-WOOD : @(Voiceover) Our plan is to hopefully sell them us first so that they will accept ideas from us .

##221655 THE JOURNEY HOME Announcer : @(Voiceover) 48 HOURS : The Journey Home . From New York , here is Dan Rather . @!DAN-RATHER-host : Good evening . According to experts , in the next 48 hours , nearly 900 children will be abducted , most by a parent . Many of these cases last only a few days , but some can stretch to years . This is the story of one of those cases . At the center of it is one mother confronting the unthinkable : that her children not only were taken from her , but that they were then taught to believe she was their worst enemy . Susan Spencer has watched this case unfold over the last six months . Her report begins last March in Jacksonville , Florida . " TILL THE DAY I DIE " @(Footage-of-Marjori) @!Ms-MARJORIE-CHAPPE : This is Jeffrey and Kristi Gray , my children , and they 've been missing for almost five years . @(Close-up-of-photos) @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) These two pictures were taken basically two weeks before the abduction . The Missing Children Foundation , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here . @(Voiceover) They aged them as to what they think that they would look like at this age at this point . @(Photo-of-Marjorie-) @!SUSAN-SPENCER-repo : @(Voiceover) Finding her missing children has become Marjorie Chappell Gray 's obsession . @!Ms-GRAY : I will , you know , look for these children , you know , till the day I die . @(Photo-of-Marjorie-) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) She 's not seen them since 1990 . They were visiting her ex-husband , Dennis Gray , when he suddenly vanished with them . @!Ms-GRAY : The last day I saw Jeffrey , he says ... @(Photo-of-the-Grays) @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) ' Mum , I want to come home . ' I said , ' Well , you 've got a few more days with Daddy and I 'll see you then . ' He goes , ' No , I want to come home now . ' In his little way , he was trying to tell me , ' Mommy ' -- I think he knew that Dennis was going to take him . @(Photo-of-Jeffrey-a) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Jeffrey was five ; Kristi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about what I 've missed with them . I ca n't allow myself to think of the happy times I 've had with them . It is too painful . If I do that , I ca n't cope . qwq @ ( Photo-of-Jeffrey ; - @!Ms-GRAY : I 'm right here . I 'm not going to let you go . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) To stay sane , Marjorie focuses on her three-year-old , Adam , her child with her second husband . @!Ms-GRAY : I 've had people say , ' Well , at least you have Adam . ' Wrong . I do n't have all of my family . @(Home-video-of-Marj) @!JEFFREY-GRAY : Michael said he 's going to keep my toys , and I said , ' No , you not . ' @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) I think what I remember most about Jeffrey -- his sweetness . He was very loving towards his sister , Kristi , three . Kristi had an attitude at three . @!SPENCER : When Dennis Gray took Jeffrey and Kristi from this Jacksonville house where he lived , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned it very well , had read books on how to survive in hiding and even set up aliases and new identities . qwq @ ( Photo-of-Dennis-Gr Mr. @!MICHAEL NAUGHTON ( Dennis Gray 's Attorney ) : @(Voiceover) Mr. Gray believed that his children were being harmed . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Michael Naughton , Dennis Gray 's attorney , remembers an angry and bitter client . He made allegations that she had abused the children sexually , allegations for which , it turned out , as far as anybody can tell , there was n't any evidence . @!Mr-NAUGHTON : I 'm firmly convinced that Mr. Gray believed those allegations . I do n't believe these children were ever abused by anybody , Mom or Dad . @(Family-photos-show) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Not to say that either was the perfect parent . At one point , the courts ordered both Marjorie and Dennis into counseling . But after that and a full investigation , Marjorie won sole custody . @!Mr-NAUGHTON : What he did , I believe , he did out of love and desperation . @(Footage-of-Marjori) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Marjorie sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave me , I will make you pay for the rest of your life . ' I -- I knew he could n't hurt me any more , but he 'd take my children away -- he would devastate my life . And that 's what he 's done . @(To-Adam) Say , ' Bye , park . See you later . ' @(Footage-of-Marjori) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Marjorie blames the strain of the search for the breakup of her second marriage . And she says that as the years have worn on , the local police seem to have lost interest in her kids . @!Mr-DON-WOOD-@1Chil : It 's up North somewhere . @!Ms-GRAY : The police department has come up with nothing . @(Photos-of-the-chil) @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) They 're so overladen , they ca n't help us . So -- and that 's why I said we 're basically on our own . And the attitude , when people say , ' Oh , well , he 's with the other parent , ' the thing is it 's kidnapping . @(Footage-of-map) @!Mr-WOOD : @(Voiceover) We could run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that we had for leads up in here . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Hiring private investigators drove her into bankruptcy . @!Ms-GRAY : I 've had bounty hunters call me , ' I can find your children , $ 100,000. ' @!SPENCER : You 're kidding ? @!Ms-GRAY : No. @(Footage-of-Don-Woo) @!Mr-WOOD : Yeah , it looks like a quick left . This has got to be it . @!Ms-GRAY : I thought , ' My gosh , it boils down to the almighty dollar , does n't it ? ' And that 's the frustrating part of it : These are children and that there is no help . @(Footage-of-Don-Woo) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Or at least there was n't until last year ... @!Mr-WOOD : Got all the photos there ? @(Footage-of-price-l) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... when Don Wood and his non-profit group called Child Watch joined in the search . @!Mr-WOOD : We 're looking for some children that were abducted about five years ago . Unidentified Woman 1 : Yeah , we -- I 've seen him before in here . @!Ms-GRAY : You have ? Woman 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently pass through this Jacksonville motel months ago , but he 's long gone now . @!Mr-WOOD : @(Voiceover) Law enforcement ca n't do it all . There 's a lot of pressure on them to handle so many different types of cases that there 's nobody that specializes in this type of work . Woman 1 : They have all their records right here , and if you want to go through them , you 're more than welcome . @!Mr-WOOD : Would you mind if we did that ? Woman 1 : No. @!Ms-GRAY : Great . @!Mr-WOOD : Great . @!Ms-GRAY : Thank you . @(Footage-of-Hopewel) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Child Watch also tracked Dennis Gray in 1994 to Hopewell , Virginia , where his brother lives . Local police were alerted . @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) Instead of going out there and driving and watching , watching to see if Dennis showed up , a patrol car went straight to the brother 's house -- knock , knock , knock . ' Is there a Dennis Gray here ? He 's a wanted felon . ' ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By which time he was able to tip Dennis and the children and they were gone . They lost him . And I was , ' No ! ' Because I 've never been that -- never been that close to them ever . @!SPENCER : However , the incident here in Virginia does at least bring in the FBI and confirms the theory that Dennis Gray 's relatives not only know where he is , but are helping him hide . Furthermore , investigators suspect that , through the years , Gray also has been in contact with the parents of his second wife , the Stuckeys. @(Footage-of-Wood-an) @!Mr-WOOD : We 're going to go to the parents of Marlene Stuckey , his new wife . I 'm hoping that by just talking to the mother and father , maybe they -- they would like to see their daughter come home . @!Ms-GRAY : Go left . @!Mr-WOOD : Left ? @!Ms-GRAY : Yeah . There 's always apprehension because you do n't know if it 's going to make them bolt like a wild horse . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) After two visits , Don Wood convinces the family to talk with state prosecutor Lance Day . @!Mr-WOOD : Hello . We 're here to see Lance Day . @!Mr-LANCE-DAY-@1Sta : Mr. Stuckey -- let 's take him first . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) The Stuckeys , at first , claim ignorance . @!Mr-STUCKEY : Difficult not knowing when and where they are or anything else . You do n't hear anything , it kind of leaves you hanging in the dark . Unidentified Woman 2 : OK . Do you swear to tell the truth , so help you , God ? @!Mr-STUCKEY : Yes . @!Mr-DAY : I 've asked you to come down to my office today to give me a sworn statement about any information you have into the disappearance of Jeffrey or Kristi Gray . @!Mrs-STUCKEY : This thing needs to come to an end . We need to have everybody home . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Mrs. -St @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Incredibly , in five years , neither police nor prosecutors ever has interviewed the Stuckeys. @!Mrs-STUCKEY : They need to be home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that you 've lied about material fact , do you understand that you could be charged with perjury ? @!Mr-STUCKEY : Yes . @(Footage-of-the-Stu) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Finally , the Stuckeys do recall that , in fact , they have seen Dennis Gray , their daughter and the children three times since 1990. @!Mr-DAY : Mrs. Stuckey , your husband wants to have a word with you . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) But they still insist they do n't know where they are now . @!Mr-DAY : In this type of crime , it 's very frustrating because the family is the information source . They set up this ... @(Missing-children-p) @!Mr-DAY : @(Voiceover) ... this underground network . They provide housing for their -- for the suspect . They provide money , shelter , everything . And that 's what 's very , very hard -- to break through that . @(Footage-of-trailer) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) While she waits for that breakthrough ... @!Ms-GRAY : Lee is 4 ' 2 " . I just want to see just how big you are , OK ? @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lens here . @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... today making ID cards . @!Ms-GRAY : That 's my picture of my daughter right there , Kristi. @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) Though she does n't yet know it ... @(Footage-of-Dennis-) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) ... authorities will find Dennis Gray . @!Mr-DENNIS-GRAY-@1F : If protecting your children and loving your children is a crime , then I 'm guilty . @(Photo-of-the-Gray-) @!SPENCER : @(Voiceover) And the children he says he loves will now say they hate their mother . @!SPENCER : Did she hurt you , you think ? @!MICHAEL-@1Renamed- : ( Nods ) @!SPENCER : Are you sure ? @!MICHAEL : Yeah . @!Ms-GRAY : You have n't seen the kids for five years . You want to hug them . You want to kiss them . You want to say , ' Gee , I have been looking for you . ' @(Footage-of-the-Gra) @!Ms-GRAY : @(Voiceover) And they do not want to see me.
