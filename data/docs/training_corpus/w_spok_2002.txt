And here again is Charles Osgood . @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Wonder Boy sounds like the name of a superhero , but , in fact , it refers to that writer of wonderful fiction , Michael Chabon . For the second chapter of our book series , In Their Own Words , Rita Braver introduces us to a novelist with writing powers and abilities far beyond those of most mortals . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Michael Unidentified Child : " Spiderman " comics . @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) He could be any mild-mannered father taking his " Superman " -smitten son to a comic book convention . @!Mr-MICHAEL-CHABON- : @(Voiceover) I grew up as a comic book reader . I read them for years as a child . Ooh , look at that . There 's Captain America . @(Footage-of-Chabon-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But this is Michael Chabon , whose love of comic books led him to write another kind of book , a big zowie , wowie novel that won him , at age 37 , the 2001 Pulitzer Prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Clay , " the tale of two cousins who create a superhero dubbed the Escapist . The scene is New York City in the 1930s and ' 40s. @!Mr-CHABON : I 'd always sort of been harboring this idea of trying to write something that would be set in this period . It suddenly occurred to me that comic books -- this thing that I had loved so much as a child , was a really great vehicle , a way into that material for me ; that i -- that was what pushed me back to comics . @(Footage-of-vintage) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) To the golden age of comic books . Chabon 's two main characters struggle to decide what powers to give their superhero to distinguish him from other comic book characters . @!Mr-CHABON : @(Voiceover) ' They considered the primates : the Monkey , Gorilla Man , the Gibbon , the Ape , the Mandril with his multicolored wonder ass that -- that he used to bedazzle opponents . @(Vintage-footage-an) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Chabon 's novel is about much more than comic books . It 's driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds ; a story about lost innocence and the meaning of love and family . Times Square , the Empire State Building , the 1939 World 's Fair all play a role . Real-life figures like Harry Houdini , Joe DiMaggio and Orson Welles make appearances ; so do the GIs heading off to fight Hitler and the Jewish refugees who flee him . When you wrote this book , did you know where you were going ? Had you outlined it in your mind ? @!Mr-CHABON : No . Absolutely not . I start -- typically , I do n't do that until I 'm well along in the book . I -- I -- I subscribe to what I call the perdition theory of writing a novel , which is that you just try to get as lost as you possibly can . @(Footage-of-book-si) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) The fact that he emerged , 639 pages later , with a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is still an amazing adventure for him . @!Mr-CHABON : Thank you . Thank you . Unidentified Woman 1 : Thank you . I loved it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll shake your hand . Thank you very much . Unidentified Woman 1 : Yeah . @(Footage-of-book-si) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Chabon seemed destined for literary fame . He first drew critical praise in graduate school when his masters thesis was published , a coming of age novel called " The Mysteries of Pittsburgh . " You never really had to have a day job , did you ? @!Mr-CHABON : Not since I 've started publishing , no . I mean , I s -- I sold my first novel when I was 23 , 24 -- almost 24 . And from that time , I have supported myself by writing of one kind of another . @!BRAVER : You also did n't suffer rejection that writers sometimes suffer . @!Mr-CHABON : Well , maybe rightly or wrongly , I take comfort in another famous saying by Flannery O'Connor , the great short story writer , who said , you know , ' Anyone ' -- I do n't know exact -- the exact quote , but ' Anyone who has survived childhood has enough material to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . ' @(Footage-of-cover-o) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) The critics also loved his second novel published in 1995 . It was called " Wonder Boys . " @!Mr-CHABON : @(Voiceover) I wanted to write about a teacher-student relationship . And I had this idea -- this -- I started with this initial image of this student standing , holding this little gun , sort of maybe thinking actually about killing himself , and the teacher coming upon him ... qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Wond @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) " Wonder Boys " became a movie starring Michael Douglas as the teacher and Tobey Maguire as the student . Like his first book , " Wonder Boys " was a relatively straightforward story . @!Mr-JONATHAN-YARDLE : Oh , I think Chabon is an en -- enormously gifted writer and an extraordinary prose style and a -- and a stu -- and a remarkable facility with words . @(Footage-of-book-re) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But when Jonathan Yardley , The Washington Post 's senior book critic , reviewed " Wonder Boys , " he issued a challenge to the young author . @!Mr-YARDLEY : OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time to him -- for him to take the next step up and just see if he can write something th -- that gets out of himself , that 's big and ambitious . @!Mr-CHABON : You know , that was just what I was thinking , but I was afraid . @(Footage-of-book-cl) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Afraid , as he recounted for Yardley and the audience at this Washington Post authors event , because Chabon had spent five and a half years trying to write another complex novel , called " Fountain City , " a big book he never finished , leaving him apprehensive about starting another . @!Mr-CHABON : It -- it helped so much -- let 's put it that way -- to have -- to have this sort of avuncular hand placed on my shoulder . And -- and -- and to get that kind of encouragement was really what -- the last sort of vote I needed . @(Footage-of-people-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) As it is in all of Chabon 's novels , the issue of homosexuality is an important theme in " Kavalier &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a much more fluid -- naturally , a much more fluid thing than our society really permits it to be . And that friendships between men , I see them as being a muc -- a very sad state nowadays . @!BRAVER : When you have written about men 's relationships ... @!Mr-CHABON : Right . @!BRAVER : ... there have been questions about your own sexuality . @!Mr-CHABON : Of course . The things that you write about , people automatically assume you must have done ... @!BRAVER : But you did n't seem to care that they ... @!Mr-CHABON : I do n't care . What dif -- who cares ? What difference does it make ? I mean , it 's -- what I do care about is knowing that I have a gay readership -- a large gay readership -- I mean , I hope I do . I hope I 've held onto it . @(Footage-of-Chabon-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Chabon has been married for eight years to Ayelet Waldman , a lawyer turned mystery writer . They have three children , a baby born just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We met on a blind date . We were fixed up by my roommate and his best friend . And I had n't read any of Michael 's books before , but as soon as I read the books , I was very nervous . And he was standing there with a bouquet of irises . And I had this remarkable reaction . I -- it was n't like I heard , you know , singing angels or doves . I just thought , ' Now I can stop dating . This is the man I 'm going to marry . ' And I proposed three weeks later , and he accepted and that was that . @!BRAVER : Did you know , too , right away , Michael ? @(Photograph-of-Chab) @!Mr-CHABON : Yeah , definitely . It was love at first sight . I just saw her standing there , and she just looked so beautiful ... @!Ms-WALDMAN : Oh . @!Mr-CHABON : ... and -- and it was -- it was that -- the thunderbolt . qwq @ ( Footage-of-house ; - @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Chabon writes in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He writes through the night , from 10 PM to 3 AM. @!Mr-CHABON : @(Voiceover) I 'm just a night person . I mean , even before I had kids , it worked well for me . Just my temperament , I 'm a -- I 'm awake then . You can keep your shoes on . @!BRAVER : Thank you . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Chabon ' @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) He is surrounded by his research books . @!Mr-CHABON : In many ways , this book was -- this book was the start of it all for me. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) His notebooks . @!Mr-CHABON : This is my latest work . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And the computer where he has designed his own Web site . @!Mr-CHABON : I call it Bumps On My Head . And as you can see , it 's a phrenological head of sort of a vintage image . @(Footage-of-comic-b) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Naturally , there 's comic book art on the wall ; a drawing by Jack Kirby , creator of " Captain America . " @!Mr-CHABON : @(Voiceover) Kirby just never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think writing is all about , is dreaming up worlds . Unidentified Woman 2 : At this point , our next author needs no introduction , but I 'll say it anyway because I just love saying it . Ladies and gentlemen , Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon. @(Footage-of-Chabon-) @!BRAVER : Do you feel a lot of pressure , you know , because people really are going to be looking at the next one ? @!Mr-CHABON : No . I mean , I -- yes , I do feel pressure , but I always feel pressure . I put a lot of pressure on myself and I always have . Unidentified Man 1 : Thanks again . Congratulations . @!Mr-CHABON : My pleasure . Thank you . Thanks for coming . @(Footage-of-Chabon-) @!Mr-CHABON : @(Voiceover) But then again , I do n't know . I 've ne -- never won a Pulitzer Prize before , so maybe it will just destroy me utterly . And -- and next time you come to talk to me , I 'll be lying in a gutter somewhere . @(Footage-of-Chabon-) @!Mr-CHABON : Hi . Unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your writing . And I ... qwq @ ( Footage-of-book-si Reporter : @(Voiceover) Somehow , I kind of doubt that . Unidentified Woman 3 : And I buy them as presents .

##54665 SIGN CITY @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : The signs in Sign City are n't made of flashing neon or painted billboards . Far from it , as you can see . The signs of which we speak are the sum total of all the daily conversations deaf people have in one particular American city that goes all-out to make them feel at home . For a year now , Martha Teichner has been eavesdropping , and this morning , she takes us on the first of two visits . @(Footage-of-Starbuc) @!MARTHA-TEICHNER-re : @(Voiceover) What could be more ordinary than afternoon coffee in Rochester , New York ? Unidentified Woman 1 : It 's $1.51. @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) But watch this . @(Footage-of-custome) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) That 's ' A grand latte , please , ' in American Sign Language .

Wherever you look , there are signs , literally signs of a culture within a culture . qwq @ ( Footage-of-group-o Unidentified Woman 3 : Show me in sign language how you would do this sign . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) It is the very visible intersection of the two that makes Rochester unique . People say that Rochester is probably the most deaf-friendly city anywhere . What did you find when you moved here ? @!Dr-CAROLYN-STERN-@ : It was a little bit of a culture shock . I would go into a gas station and ask for directions and somebody would start signing to me. qwq @ ( Footage-of-Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , moved to Rochester from Chicago three years ago to open what she believes is the only medical practice in the United States specifically for the deaf . @!Dr-STERN : But he smells you , so when he smells you , he wants to look for you . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) She is deaf , but you 'd hardly know it . How deaf are you ? @!Dr-STERN : Like wood . I do n't hear anything without my implant on . I hear nothing . @!TEICHNER : Can -- can you see it ? I mean , is it ins -- what do you see ? I see a little wire ... @!Dr-STERN : You see a little wire and then behind my hearing aid ... @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Every morning Dr. Stern attaches a microphone to the magnetic transmitter surgically implanted behind her ear . @!Dr-STERN : So ... @!TEICHNER : What 's that ? @!Dr-STERN : This is the processor -- the speech processor . @!TEICHNER : For the cochlear implant . @!Dr-STERN : Right . @(Footage-of-Stern-h) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Cochlear implants are controversial among the deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be the impossible : Use a stethoscope. @!Dr-STERN : This is a stethoscope .

And a deep breath in and hold it . @(Footage-of-activit) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Dr. Stern 's office looks like any other doctor 's except that just about everybody signs . The deaf ca n't pick up a phone and make an appointment or explain a problem , so there is a TTY , a telephone-teletype machine . @!Dr-STERN : Hi , Susan . How are you ? This is Dr. Stern calling . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) If Dr. Stern has to phone another doctor or a hearing patient -- yes , she has hearing patients -- she has a full-time interpreter , signing to her what 's being said . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Dr. -Ste @!Dr-STERN : Good , and your arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Just as most cities have temporary help agencies , Rochester has agencies that supply interpreters for the deaf . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Dr. -Ste @!Dr-STERN : Do you smoke at all , cigarettes ? Unidentified Woman 4 : I 'm just quitting right now . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Ironically , for every one deaf patient , the practice has attracted two hearing . @!Dr-STERN : I have told hearing patients I 'm deaf , you need to look at me when you talk to me . So I 'm not worried about your circulation . Unidentified Woman 4 : OK. @!Dr-STERN : OK . Most of them are , like , ' OK . What 's next ? ' @(Footage-of-Welcome) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) So how did Rochester get to be , in effect , the deaf capital of the United States ? Because for more than 125 years , it 's been a center of deaf education . The story of Rochester 's special relationship with the deaf begins here , at the Rochester School for the Deaf . @(Vintage-photograph) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) For a long time after the Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standard practice to try and teach deaf children to speak and lip-read as if they were hearing . For more than 100 years , until the mid-1970s , the closest thing to sign language permitted anywhere on campus was a tedious method of finger-spelling English , in other words , English on the hands . It was actually called the Rochester method . @(Photographs-of-dea) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) The prevailing assumption , not just in Rochester but throughout the United States , was that success meant bringing the deaf into the hearing world . qwq @ ( Footage-of-deaf-ch Unidentified Boy : Chicago . Unidentified Woman 5 : Yes . Now get the accent right . Chicago . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Teaching the deaf to speak and lip-read is difficult . Educators were afraid that if sign language were allowed , learning English would be even harder , so it was banned in many deaf schools . Unidentified Boy : Chicago , Chicago . Unidentified Woman 5 : Good speech . @(Footage-of-people-) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) So how did sign language become the language of choice ? All the time it was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social circles and deaf clubs , American Sign Language , or ASL , was spreading almost like an underground movement , its vocabulary vivid and full of visual imagery . @!Mr-PATRICK-GRAYBIL : ( Through Interpreter ) There 's such a richness in it and there 's so many ways to play with the signs . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Noted deaf actor and poet Patrick Graybill speaking through an interpreter . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : In English , if you 're speaking , you have one mouth , but we have two hands , and you can use both hands to sign something different at the same time . For example , this is the sign for tree and this is the sign for car . You can explain a car hitting a tree all at one action , as opposed to English being very linear , a car hit a tree . There 's no picture there . You ca n't create a picture while you 're expressing it . @(Footage-of-demonst) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) It was no coincidence that efforts to make ASL mainstream coincided with the civil rights era . Getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle for deaf culture with huge implications for Rochester ... qwq @ ( Footage-of-road-in Unidentified Woman 6 : Hello , may I help you ? @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) ... and huge implications for Karen Christie . We also spoke to her through an interpreter . @!Ms-KAREN-CHRISTIE : ( Through Interpreter ) For me really , it 's like I grew up as a hearing person who just could n't , quote , " hear . " I did n't even know the meaning of deaf , because growing up I never really saw deaf people . @(Footage-of-Karen-C) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Like so many other deaf Americans educated before ASL was widely accepted , growing up in California , Karen Christie was expected to sink or swim in public school and did n't learn sign language until college . How did your life change ? What did you do differently when you learned sign language and got acquainted with deaf culture ? @!Ms-CHRISTIE : ( Through Interpreter ) The thought of trying to communicate with my voice and listening to a classroom used to seem impossible . But here , with deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my professional opportunities open up . I saw what I can do , not what I am limited by . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Karen Christie is an English professor at NTID , the National Technical Institute for the Deaf . But here classes are taught in American Sign Language . @(Footage-of-student) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Why did Rochester go from being a city with a deaf school to the deaf capital of the United States ? NTID. @(Photographs-of-peo) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Created by an act of Congress , it is the nation 's only technical college for the deaf . It opened in 1968 right about the time ASL really came into its own . Here there are 1,200 students , plus faculty and support staff , all signing to each other in class and out . @(Footage-of-classes) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) NTID has been a magnet , drawing deaf students to Rochester , students who often stay on . It is the nucleus of a community that exists within the comfort zone of American Sign Language . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : American Sign Language is my native language . It 's what I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf make a distinction between little D deaf , trying to live and speak in the hearing world , and big D deaf , fully embracing sign language and deaf culture . The monthly book club both Patrick Graybill and Karen Christie belong to is big D deaf culture at its highest level . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : ( Through Interpreter ) As a poet , I have the license to play and to sign like an artist . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) This is one of his poems . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : ( Through Interpreter ) The title is " Fireflies . " The sign for that is this , opening and closing of the hand . It was dark ... @(Footage-of-Graybil) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Watch how the sign for fireflies takes on different meanings ... @!Mr-GRAYBILL : ( Through Interpreter ) I am fifty . @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) ... how Graybill uses it to create sign language rhymes . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : ( Through Interpreter ) I am so excited . What am I going to do ? There 's the door . Hello ! Oh , we talk and we talk and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They leave . Hey , I am fifty . It 's wonderful . @!TEICHNER : What is this ? Unidentified Woman 7 : ( Through Interpreter ) Oh , good question . As opposed to clapping , because clapping is a -- a sound , we visually applaud . @!Mr-GRAYBILL : ( Through Interpreter ) Very nice . Very nice . @(Footage-of-people-) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) It is that proud big D deaf culture that Scott Matchett was born into . By his second birthday Scott was learning sign language the way hearing toddlers learn baby talk . @(Footage-of-Scott-M) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) His parents are deaf , so is his younger sister . The chance of that happening -- two deaf children born to deaf parents -- is unlikely . @!Mr-MATCHETT : It was like it 's almost impossible to have deaf children but it turned out to be that ... @!TEICHNER : Two deaf children . @!Yeah-Bam-bam -- yea# @(Footage-of-Matchet) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Scott is 10 now , his sister Kara , seven . You look at the Matchetts and you see your typical all-American family , except that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how did they live their lives . @(Footage-of-Matchet) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) For over a year , the Matchetts have been sharing theirs with us and next week on SUNDAY MORNING with you . @(Photograph-of-Matc) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Next , color it green ? @(Announcements) 
##54666 GESUNDHEIT ! ! @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : To say ' gesundheit ' is the least we can do for somebody who sneezes from a cold . And unfortunately , until now , it 's been just about all we could do . The common cold has been uncommonly resistant to any effective medical cure . But now at least some small measure of help is on the way . Our cover story is reported by Elizabeth Kaledin. @(Footage-of-man-sne) @!ELIZABETH-KALEDIN- : @(Voiceover) Not everyone feels like singing about it , but it 's the rare person who has n't experienced the common cold . Americans sniffle and sneeze their way through a billion colds every year . @(Footage-of-people-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) It 's a familiar foe , but just what is the common cold ? @!Dr-SCOTT-HAMMER-@1 : The common cold basically is a runny nose , sore throat , congestion and just feeling ill. @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) So how is that different from the flu ? Dr. Scott Hammer is chief of infectious diseases at New York 's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center . @!Dr-HAMMER : The flu , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more systemic symptoms such as fever , severe muscle aches , real serious tiredness feeling , often a significant cough ... @(Footage-of-people-) @!Dr-HAMMER : @(Voiceover) ... and then in some percentage of people , complications of -- of the -- of the lungs , which can be quite life-threatening. @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Most of the time a cold is not life-threatening , of course . But it does make us miserable . Every year Americans spend millions on cold relief and researchers are busily searching for elusive treatments . It may be a common cold but it 's not simple . @!Ms-LINDA-LAMBERT-@ : I think one vaccine or one drug that 's going -- going to work to -- to -- to prevent common cold for everyone , I think , is -- is -- is pretty -- pretty challenging . @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Linda Lambert coordinates cold research for the National Institutes of Health . @!Ms-LAMBERT : @(Voiceover) And I say that because there 's a lot of very different viruses that cause the common cold . @!KALEDIN : If there were a single culprit for the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 200 different viruses that cause the common cold . The most common is called the rhinovirus , ' rhino ' being Greek for nose , and there are about 110 different strains of rhinovirus alone . @!Dr-HAMMER : It first enters either in the nose or the mouth . @(Footage-of-animati) @!Dr-HAMMER : It attack -- attaches to the surface lining cells of th -- of those areas , gets into those cells and starts to grow and what we call replicate ; it multiplies itself . @(Footage-of-people-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) As the virus multiplies , the body kicks into gear to fight the attack . That runny nose and cough you have is not virus , per se . It 's your body 's way of fighting the virus , of flooding it out of your system . So the runny nose and the cough and the congestion are actually the body 's way of fighting the cold ? @!Dr-JACK-GWALTNEY : Exactly . Sometimes it 's not a very good way . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Dr. -Gwa @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Dr. Jack Gwaltney has devoted his career , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , as -- as a society , do we need to conquer the cold ? @!Dr-GWALTNEY : Well , I 've had colds . I guess you 've had colds . They make you feel bad and doctors are committed to treating diseases that make you feel bad . @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Over the years , Dr. Gwaltney says he has mastered the secret to staying healthy . @!Dr-GWALTNEY : Well , the best way to avoid colds is to be a hermit. @(Footage-of-people-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) But since for most of us that 's not an option , drug researchers are focused on finding ways to attack the virus before it has a chance to multiply . Leading the pack of these drugs is the newest development on the cold scene , an antiviral drug called pleconaril . The drug fits exactly into pockets on the surface of the virus , preventing it from attaching to the cell . If the virus were a lock , and the cell surface a key , the drug essentially keeps the key from fitting into the lock . Infection ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : @(Voiceover) Developed by a company called ViroPharma , pleconaril is expected to be approved by the FDA in the next few months . But pleconaril is not a cure . What studies show pleconaril can do is shorten a cold 's duration by a day or a day and a half . So you 're growing the cold in here . @!Dr-FRED-HAYDEN-@1U : We 're -- we 're trying to grow common cold viruses here to see ... @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Dr. Fred Hayden and his team at the University of Virginia tested pleconaril in more than 2,000 people . @(Footage-of-laborat) @!Dr-HAYDEN : What we found in these clinical studies was that early treatment , that is , with 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms in adults , we 've -- showed a shortening of the duration of the common cold illness and also a reduction in its severities. @(Footage-of-people-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) And while shortening your cold by a day may not sound like much , multiply one day by a billion colds every year and it adds up medically and perhaps more important economically . @!Ms-LAMBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immense . There 's a huge number -- a huge economic loss in terms of days of lost work and days that you have to take care of kids , days out of school . @(Footage-of-Hammer-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Which is why infectious disease experts like Columbia 's Scott Hammer say Pleconaril is nothing to sneeze at . Well , how big a deal is this drug ? @!Dr-HAMMER : OK . Well , to pick an adjective to answer your question , I would probably pick it as a modest but significant breakthrough . @(Footage-of-Hayden-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Dr. Hayden is also testing pleconaril 's preventive powers and studying whether or not it works in children , important next steps in the ' cold war . ' @(Footage-of-Gwaltne) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) As for Dr. Gwaltney , he 's at work on a cold cocktail , if you will , including an anti-viral like pleconaril and some other drugs to target specific symptoms . @!Dr-GWALTNEY : It 's got interferon , a first-generation antihistamine , and we 're using a drug called chlorphaneramine -- it 's a common antihistamine -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter or what ? @!Dr-GWALTNEY : It -- it would certainly start out as a prescription drug , but I think any cold treatment ultimately has to be over the counter if it 's really going to benefit people . @!KALEDIN : Right . @!Dr-GWALTNEY : You do n't have time to go to your doctor and get diagnosed . If you wait , you 've lost the game . qwq @ ( Footage-of-patient Unidentified Woman 1 : So unfortunately the only time I 'm feeling good is on the antibiotic , though . Unidentified Man 1 : OK . Well , as I discussed , we 're going to try to avoid antibiotic use . @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) One of the main reasons there 's pressure to develop new cold drugs is to stop the misuse of antibiotics to treat the common cold . qwq @ ( Footage-of-child-b Unidentified Woman 2 : How 's your nose ?

One of the few things we know with certainty about colds is ... @!Ms-LAMBERT : That antibiotics do not work against viruses , common cold viruses , flu viruses . @(Footage-of-people-) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) What else do we know for sure about colds ? Well , there 's definitely a cold season -- fall , winter and spring -- and the virus is most commonly spread by small children . The average American child brings home between 6 and 10 colds a year resulting in two to four colds for the average adult . We also know that aside from being a hermit , the single best thing you can do to prevent a cold is wash your hands , often and well . @(Graphic-of-rules-f) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) Also , get plenty of rest , avoid stress , exercise and eat well . Of course , amid all the cold facts , there 's plenty of fiction . @!Dr-HAMMER : You know , you do n't get a cold by going out in the cold weather after a shower despite what my mother told me. @!KALEDIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . @!Dr-GWALTNEY : The Romans said if you kissed the hairy muzzle of a mouse , it was a good treatment for a cold . And that 's one extreme . @!KALEDIN : What else ? @!Dr-GWALTNEY : Thomas Jefferson believed if -- that by soaking his feet in cold water every morning that he had prevented himself from catching a lot of colds . Unidentified Man 2 : Would you like to try some homemade chicken noodle soup ? @(Footage-of-jars-of) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) On the other hand , even though there 's never been a clinical trial to test it , chicken soup does seem to help . What about vitamin C , zinc , echinacea , theses new things that people are spending a fortune on ? @!Dr-HAMMER : The data so far , at least as I interpret them , suggest that those interventions really do n't work very effectively . @(Footage-of-man-wit) @!KALEDIN : @(Voiceover) A cure for the common cold ?

##54670 CHARLES @!OSGOOD , host : You may recall that we took a trip last week to Rochester , New York -- Sign City we called it -- a place where the deaf live in such numbers that signing is among the most common of sights . This morning Martha Teichner takes us back for another visit , not to the whole city this time , just to one remarkable family . qwq @ ( Footage-of-school ; @!MARTHA-TEICHNER-re : @(Voiceover) This is what arriving at school is like for most children .

She lost her hearing at age two , the result of meningitis . It seemed a genetic improbability that Scott would be born deaf . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : @(Voiceover) It took me a couple of days to accept because I knew how much my parents went through with me . It was hard work . And I thought , ' Oh . ' But then I said , ' OK . Move on . ' @(Footage-of-Kara-Ma) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Two years later Scott 's sister Kara was born deaf . By that time , the Matchetts had moved on .

Is it more fun for your children than it was for you ? @!Mrs-MATCHETT : Yes . At that time , there was no closed caption . @!TEICHNER : No closed caption . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : No . And I would always ask my brother or my mother and father , ' What did they say ? What did he say ? What did she say ? ' We missed a lot .

He remembers the pain and isolation of his own childhood . @!Mr-MATCHETT : @(Voiceover) My family kind of moved around a lot . So for every time we moved to a new town or a new school , then I would have a -- a hard time or a big challenge of making new friends because when they first saw me and saw me with the hearing aids on , that something 's wrong with me , they 'd make fun of me. @(Childhood-photo-of) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) It helped that growing up he was a champion swimmer , but public school was lonely and hard for him . @!Mr-MATCHETT : It 's tough to be in a no-man 's land like myself because , to the hearing world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm hearing . @!TEICHNER : How is that ? @!Mrs-MATCHETT : Why is that ? Because to the deaf world , I can speak . @(Photo-of-Doug) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Doug Matchett was expected to speak and lip-read exclusively . He did n't even learn sign language until he was 22 when he enrolled at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf , or NTID , in Rochester . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : For me , I remember I would come home so exhausted from lip-reading all day in the classroom , playing sports . I would take a nap for hours . @(Childhood-photos-o) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) At three , Mary Karol was sent away to a deaf school , where she , too , was taught to speak and lip-read .

Doug is a civil engineer , who 's recently become an insurance broker . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : How many ? @!KAROL-MATCHETT : Four . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : Four . @(Footage-of-Matchet) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Successful professionals , the Matchetts make life for the deaf look easy , but after more than a year with them , we 've begun to understand how very much it takes every day for the deaf to step across the divide that separates them from the world of the hearing . We have also begun to understand how rarely it works the other way . @!Mrs-MATCHETT : Both our kids are fortunate to have us. @(Footage-of-Matchet) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Because the Matchetts have their own experience to draw on , as they address what they consider the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing schools for Scott and Kara ... @(Footage-of-school-) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) ... deaf vs. hearing , which kind of school is better .

You ca n't imagine it . Why ? @!Mrs-MATCHETT : Because it 's so small . I mean , it 's perfect for social and for community , yes , but for career , no. @(Footage-of-childre) @!TEICHNER : Looming over every education decision the Matchetts make for their children is a disturbing statistic .

He was under age , but his parents allowed it as long as he kept his grades up . Soon after he finished school , he got his first big break . It happened when Billy Eckstine came to town . @!Mr-CAWTHRA : And the Eckstine band was extraordinary . They came to town and Art Blakey was the drummer , and Charlie Parker and Lucky Thompson and Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan were all in this band . The trumpet player fell ill .

Soon he was spending more time in the jazz clubs than the classroom . Now Miles was playing regularly with his idols , Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie , uptown in Harlem and downtown in the jazz clubs on 52nd Street . His collaborations with Gil Evans led to the classic " Birth of the Cool , " and the emergence of Miles ' own distinctive sound . @(Photograph-of-Davi) @!TAYLOR : @(Voiceover) Then , it was on to Paris , where he met the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and the painter Pablo Picasso , and fell in love with actress Juliette Greco . He composed a film score , and became the toast of the town . Miles said he never felt better in his life . @(Footage-of-New-Yor) @!TAYLOR : @(Voiceover) But that natural high ended when Miles came home to an America where discrimination was still commonplace , and a changed New York music scene where there were fewer opportunities for black jazz musicians . At age 23 , Miles began to use drugs . @(Photographs-of-Dav) @!TAYLOR : @(Voiceover) Heroin become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think that that fundamentally changed Miles Davis as -- as -- as a person who came from East St. Louis , privileged , to New York , you know , came into the music , met all those great players , and really was playing , and then with the drug habit , it sent him , you know , spiraling down into , you know , whatever -- I mean , you -- he -- it made him a st -- just an ordinary street hustler . @!TAYLOR : Where did he get the strength to come out of that ? Most of the people , like Byrd and many others , never made it out of that . @!Mr-TROUPE : I think it was his father , because his father really , really , really believed in him .

It marked a major change in musical direction and the beginning of one of Miles ' most creative periods . He used the mute on his horn more frequently to add another dimension to his already distinctive sound . One year later , he formed the famous Miles Davis Quintet , with John Coltrane , Red Garland and Philly Joe Jones and Paul Chambers . @(Footage-of-various) @!TAYLOR : @(Voiceover) He recorded one successful album after another : " Round About Midnight , " and " Milestones with the Quintet , " " Porgy and Bess " and an album with a 19-piece band , called " Miles Ahead .

Our cover story is reported by Rita Braver . @(Footage-of-Enron-b) @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) It was n't just Enron headquarters that soared over Houston , it was also the company 's gung ho attitude .

In the months before Enron 's financial woes became public , and even as top management was proclaiming the company 's financial strength , Chairman Ken Lay sold more than $37 million worth of stock ; former CEO Jeffrey Skilling sold more than $15 million worth .

He says Enron 's real problems started when the company , which had made its reputation building natural gas pipelines , decided to diversify and create a new kind of global corporation , one that speculated in futures . Enron would buy access to energy and other commodities and resell when the time was right . @!Mr-SLOAN : They were going to make markets in everything . You were going to be able to buy insurance against weather , you would be to be able to buy natural gas , you would be able to buy capacity for -- for your -- your phone system .

Banks like Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase kept making new loans , even as Enron went further into debt . @(Footage-of-Kenneth) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And everyone seemed blinded by the aggressive , ' We can do no wrong ' attitude of Enron 's top executives .

Chairman Ken Lay , who entertained President Bush at Enron Field , home of the Houston Astros , contributed another $100,000 to the Bush inaugural . Did it work ? Well , when Ken Lay finally admitted that Enron was heading for bankruptcy and called top administration officials for help , no one intervened . The White House says there was absolutely no wrongdoing , no special favors . And Enron did give campaign money to lots of Democrats , too , including Congressman John Dingell .

For Sherri and her husband Bill , it 's meant an end to dreams of travel in their golden years .

##54673 QUEEN OF THE NILE Announcer : It 's SUNDAY MORNING on CBS , and here again is Charles Osgood . @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : @!Cleopatra-The-arch# @(Footage-of-artifac) @!MARK-PHILLIPS-repo : @(Voiceover) The problem with Cleopatra is the way she 's been packaged , sometimes in crates protecting the priceless artifacts that are a testament to the greatness , power and allure of one of the most enigmatic figures in history . @(Excerpt-from-vinta) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) But there 's another kind of packaging , the kind done by Hollywood . Here it 's Claudette Colbert and the pageantry Cecil B. DeMille made famous . Here it 's Vivien Leigh as the Egyptian goddess-queen , delivered rolled up in a carpet in silks . @(Excerpts-from-movi) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Or most famously of all , Elizabeth Taylor in the violet-eyes-to-die-for version . In fact , Taylor 's breathy Cleopatra probably did more to define our image of the temptress of the Nile than 2,000 years of actual historic study . @!Mr-DAVID-FOSTER-@1 : Now what the show intends to do is sort of redress the balance and sort of dismantle that myth and take you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Entitled " Cleopatra : From History to Myth , " the show drew large crowds to the British Museum in London , and is now packing them in at the Field Museum in Chicago . Unidentified Woman 1 : Thank you . Unidentified Woman 2 : Thank you so much . @(Footage-of-exhibit) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) It 's the largest collection of Cleopatra artifacts ever assembled . These are n't just statues and ancient works of art . They are the evidence of Cleopatra 's real story . These objects were the political billboards , the TV ads , the gossip columns of the period . And the fun of this exhibit is comparing this reality with the more modern celluloid images which act as a backdrop . Either way , according to David Foster , who brought this exhibit to Chicago , it 's a hell of a story . @!Mr-FOSTER : @(Voiceover) What the curators of at the British Museum did , and I think it was a brilliant conception , they started with this name , this -- this universally recognized name , recognized for the wrong reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel away that -- those mis -- misconceptions and take you back to recover the -- the historical truth . And what you see then face-to-face is the evidence of the fact that she was , in fact , contrary to the myth , a very able , a very adroit ruler , a very accomplished woman , a very intelligent woman , a very astute woman . @(Footage-of-exhibit) @!Ms-SUSAN-WALKER-@1 : It 's a really heady mixture of high politics , sexual adventure and a perception of Cleopatra that has endured over the last 2,000 years . @(Footage-of-Susan-W) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Susan Walker of the British Museum put the exhibit together , drawing artifacts from museums around the world . @(Footage-of-statues) @!Ms-WALKER : @(Voiceover) This is a loan from Detroit , from the Institute of Fine Arts . @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Images of the great and the good of official ancient Egypt . And images pulled literally from the depths of history . This long-lost statue is believed to be that of Kaesarian , Caesar and Cleopatra 's son , discovered only recently on the bottom of Alexandria harbor . @!Ms-WALKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler , albeit with his extremely powerful mother for many years -- in fact , for 14 years -- from the age of three -- and continued to rule for a very short period after her death , but then was assassinated . @!PHILLIPS : A little nuts and bolts history might be useful here . Cleopatra was the last in the line of Greek rulers of ancient Egypt who traced their origins back to Alexander the Great . In order to consolidate her power and placate Rome , she formed a series of romantic and political alliances , first with Julius Caesar . When he died , she took up with Marc Anthony , as he fought for control of Rome with his rival , Octavian . @(Footage-of-exhibit) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) But what does the evidence show ? It shows her as a skillful politician , an able administrator in her own right . It pays to follow the money . @!Mr-JONATHAN-WILLIA : This is a coin of Cleopatra and it calls her ' Queen Cleopatra the queen of kings and of the sons of kings , ' extraordinary sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ruler of the world . @(Footage-of-William) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Jonathan Williams knows everything there is to know about the loose change of antiquity . @!Mr-WILLIAMS : @(Voiceover) Whoever chose to put Cleopatra on one side and Anthony on the other , knew that what they were doing would please the respective individuals portrayed on the coin . It 's -- you know , it 's -- it 's -- it 's a tribute to their greatness is what it is. @!PHILLIPS : It 's also kind of serving notice that they 're going steady , I suppose , or something like that . @!Mr-WILLIAMS : That 's right . That 's right . It 's -- it 's -- that 's right . That they are -- that they are a couple . They 've come together . You know , when you think of Anthony , you think of Cleopatra . @(Footage-of-coin) @!Mr-WILLIAMS : @(Voiceover) And this is -- this is really a new thing in the 30s BC. @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Two sides of the same coin ... @!Mr-WILLIAMS : @(Voiceover) Absolutely . @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) ... so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) But do the coins answer the age-old question : What was it about Cleopatra that drew the great men of her time to her , often to their ruin ? Put bluntly , was she really that gorgeous ? How do we know that 's what she looked like ? @!Mr-WILLIAMS : Well , we do n't , I think is the truth of the matter . My suspicion is that you 'd probably be able to recognize that as a portrait of the real Cleopatra were she in the room with us now . But it 's a stylized portrait . It 's a portrait of power . It does n't intend to be -- it does n't claim to be realistic . What 's important for Cleopatra 's portrait is not that she looks stunning , but that she looks really impressive . You know that you 're dealing with and looking at the face of a really powerful and impressive woman . @(Footage-of-statue) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) But beautiful ? It 's the old eye of the beholder thing . @!Mr-FOSTER : @(Voiceover) Her physical beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beholder . But the force of her personality and the charisma she projected , and -- and the intelligence she manifested , and the fact that she could speak in seven or eight languages with any ambassador that came to her court -- all of those exerted a peculiar force on -- on onlookers , and so I think the whole package was a charming , attractive package . @(Footage-of-statues) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) To complicate matters , Cleopatra 's image changes dramatically over time , depending on who was doing the sculpting . @!Ms-SALLY-ANN-ASHTO : @(Voiceover) There 's a great debate in both Greek- and Egyptian-style portraitures as to whether an image really does represent the individual 's true appearance . @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Sally-Ann Ashton ought to know . She 's credited with discovering that this statue from the San Jose Museum is actually of Cleopatra , even though it looks different from the others . The key is the tell-tale three-cobra headdress , which Sally-Ann says only a queen would wear . Whatever , so-called beauty is n't necessarily the issue . @!Ms-ASHTON : @(Voiceover) With each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a queen or a ruler should really look like . And I think perhaps slightly too much emphasis being placed on her beauty , really , rather than her achievements , her historical achievements , and also her presentation as a person , as a ruler of a very important country . @!PHILLIPS : So she need n't have been Liz Taylor ? @!Ms-ASHTON : No. @(Excerpts-from-movi) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Cleopatra 's problem is n't the way she looked ; it 's the way she was portrayed by the people who ultimately told her story . And because she had backed the wrong horse -- the loser -- in Marc Anthony , it was the victorious Octavian who got to define her , and not kindly . @!Ms-WALKER : @(Voiceover) The whore of the Kinocus , is how she was described . @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Cleopatra was dissed big time , her reputation dragged through the Roman mud . @!Mr-FOSTER : He launched a vicious propaganda war against her . And , in fact , he kind of established the motif of the -- the insatiable -- you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who unmanned Anthony and -- Cleopatra -- through sexual wiles . He -- he created that theme . And in fact , his writers were so effective that they -- they sort of guaranteed her survival through history . @(Footage-of-writing) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) For a final opinion , it 's useful to get away from the old rocks and into the literature , inevitably to Shakespeare . @(Excerpt-from-movie) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Janet Suzman is widely credited with the defining theatrical portrayal . @!Ms-JANET-SUZMAN-@1 : Well , my first impression is ' cause that is the received idea that Cleopatra is just a sexpot , and , of course , to liberated women like me , this is deeply uninteresting . @(Excerpt-from-movie) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) What Suzman discovered is that our fascination with Cleopatra is rooted in the universal theme of the historic relationship between the sexes . @!Ms-SUZMAN : It 's actually a terrible burden on women to always have to be acceptable in the bedroom rather than a boardroom . And I think Cleopatra obviously combined both . @(Excerpt-from-movie) @!Ms-SUZMAN : @(Voiceover) Something of the whore and something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cunning , must have been a pretty hot cocktail . @(Excerpt-from-movie) @!PHILLIPS : @(Voiceover) Hot enough that a couple of millennia later , she 's still a mystery .

Bob McNamara takes us along with some bird-watchers in search of a miracle . @(Footage-of-Pearl-R) @!BOB-McNAMARA-repor : @(Voiceover) If you follow the Pearl River in southeast Louisiana through stands of cypress and swamp oak and sweet gum , it will take you deep into an American wilderness and deep into the heart of a mystery . @!Mr-DAVID-KULIVAN-@ : @(Voiceover) Well , I was sitting down at the base of a -- a large oak tree in a semi-open area in the woods . I guess it was just starting to be grey light in the morning .

And that 's saying something , because according to most wildlife biologists , the bird is n't just rare , it 's extinct . The last confirmed sighting was 1941. @!Mr-JAMES-VAN-REMSE : Within the ornithological community and the -- and the bird-watching community in -- in North America , it would be a -- a tremendously important discovery . qwq @ ( Footage-of-McNamar McNAMARA : @(Voiceover) James Van Remsen teaches ornithology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge . David Kulivan is a former student . Seeing an ivory-bill in the wild , says Van Remsen , is the Holy Grail of bird-watching. @!Mr-VAN-REMSEN : It would be an emotional experience .

I do n't know what I would do if I actually saw an ivory-billed woodpecker . McNAMARA : Historically , it was in the swamp and river-bottom timberlands like this along the Gulf Coast that the ivory-billed woodpecker made its home . Unfortunately , it was the same area that became so popular with the timber cutting industry in the early 1900s , a time when the ivory-billed woodpecker began to rapidly disappear . @(Vintage-photograph) @!Ms-NANCY-TANNER-@1 : @(Voiceover) My husband , James Tanner , had studied the birds for three years , ' 37 , ' 38 and ' 39 . And right after Pearl Harbor , we went down to see if any were left . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Nancy-T McNAMARA : @(Voiceover) Perhaps no one knows the story of the ivory-billed woodpecker better than Nancy Tanner .

McNAMARA : @(Voiceover) James Tanner was also part of a Cornell University expedition , which in 1935 obtained this film ; the only film ever taken of an ivory-billed and recorded for the first and perhaps last time the bird 's eerie call . @(Vintage-footage-of) @!Mr-VAN-REMSEN : This specimen is more than 100 years old .
