Hannah wants her breakfast toast in triangles , while Esther does n't want hers toasted at all , but the bread is frozen , so Annie has laid Esther 's slices atop the warm toaster and bends towards the heat counting seconds , one one thousand , two one thousand ... She 's learned that precisely four seconds on each side will produce bread that is thawed but still cool , almost like fresh from the store . <p> Annie will not be going to the store today , nor taking the girls to pre-school although they 've asked why not -- what holiday is it ? -- will there be matzah balls ? Usually holidays have craft projects at school -- pink Mother 's Day cards just last week , surely Father 's Day cards in June although the teachers try to be sensitive . <p> " Bake now , " the girls insist , remembering helping make Hamentaschen for Purim back in March , while Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just choose . They stand in their underwear -- that 's as far as they 've gotten -- hands on hips , staring at Annie through slivered-almond eyes . They made unusual Queen Esthers at the temple Purim party -- honey-skinned Korean girls in a sea of frizzy hair and freckles . At the store , obnoxious people still stop to ask Are they yours ? <p> Neither girl has brushed her teeth , and Annie is still in what passes lately for pajamas , sweats and one of Bryan 's old Penn tees , wrapped in a ridiculous lacy robe she bought for the hospital one of the times they tried for a baby . The tee is paint-speckled , which would have pissed Bryan off . She sleeps in work clothes now , the line between asleep and awake comfortably blurred . <p> Annie is a quilter , but not like the quilts her great-grandma used to sew on the pedal machine in her basement tailor shop in East New York . Annie once quilted yards of silk she 'd painted with golden rooftops of Jerusalem . Another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags . Lately , she 's working on a series she calls list quilts , using fabric markers to sort her life into orderly lists , then covering all with intricate geometric patterns of stitching -- order from chaos . <p> 9:03 a.m . Annie finally makes her way to the living room , although living room seems a misnomer nowadays . Work -- once confined to what was the spare bedroom before the twins -- has taken over , quilts in various stages of completion , furniture pushed aside to make room for a cutting table and quilting frames , even a small printing press purchased with some of the money . <p> From her stool , Annie eyes the girls on the couch in what used to be the dining room , dismantled dining table in the basement now , holidays back at her mother 's . They have Sesame Street on TV -- she taped the 7:00a.m. show in anticipation . Their plates -- toast and non-toast -- spill crumbs onto the carpet . No breakfast for Annie today , just a glass of orange juice while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing qualities of vitamin C. <p> By the time she 's retrieved the portable TV from the kitchen , located an outlet to plug it in , and clicked it on , she 's missed the beginning of the broadcast , does n't know who 's talking . She thought the hearing was scheduled to start at 9:00 but could have gotten that wrong . The man 's voice is steady and even , like the tiny stitches she begins adding to the layered muslin stretched before her , but his words pummel her body like falling bricks . <p> He 's talking about the South Tower , as if the delivery of the report has been synchronized to the actual events . And there is the video , which Annie has seen so often it is seared inside her eyelids , materializing when she closes her eyes in bed , trying for sleep . Like the photo of Bryan she 's scanned and digitized onto the fabric in front of her -- faded shades of brown , like a daguerreotype of one of her stern Russian ancestors . Bryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of cyberspace . Cyberspace is one of the things Annie used to have faith in , unlike her mother , who 'll send an e-mail then phone to see if she 's received it . <p> " Airplane , " Hannah calls out . <p> " Fuck , " Esther responds . <p> Annie opens her eyes . Have they caught sight of her TV ? Sesame Street was intended to hold their attention . No , it 's just the Count counting vehicles -- cars , trains , airplanes -- even Sesame Street is synchronized this morning . Esther has trouble with initial consonant blends , can not say truck . Fuck , Annie silently agrees . Fuck , fuck , fuck . <p> Smoke rises on TV , and flames , and indescribable things falling from great heights , as if any moment now the parachutes will open . And the droning voice : <p> They agreed to wait for the FDNY to arrive before determining whether to evacuate the South Tower . According to one fire chief , it was unimaginable , " beyond our consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man with a face as blank as the TV screen if she crawled under her work table to yank the plug from the wall ? Where are Katie and Matt when Annie needs them , perky and reliable , Katie flashing her shiny-lipstick smile across the screen every morning ? How does she keep smiling like that , after all she 's been through ? <p> Annie tries to ignore the telephone . The machine will pick up after seven rings . They used to have it set on four . Before the girls , she and Bryan could always reach the phone by four rings , unless they were making love . What if it 's important ? Annie 'd say . What if it 's your mother ? Bryan would reply , lifting his tongue from her nipple or pausing mid-thrust . <p> Annie 's mother works at home , too , at her kitchen table , writing travel stories ( gleaned from the Internet , not from actual travel ) and comic essays that run next to real estate ads in the local weekly . She says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inordinate amount of time watching daytime television , calling Annie with tips from morning talk shows . <p> " Are you watching ? " Annie 's mother says now . <p> " I 'm trying , Mom . Until you called . " <p> " Do n't watch . You should n't even be home . You should be taking the girls to school , like an ordinary day . " <p> " Then why did you call ? " <p> " Because I knew you 'd be watching . " Her mother has become a font of mixed messages , questioning why Annie never went to temple Friday nights to say kaddish while simultaneously advocating mind over matter , positive thinking . <p> Annie hangs up , grasps her glass . There is vodka in her orange juice , just this once , and an ache beginning to form at the base of her stomach like she 's getting her period , her relentless period . <p> On an early list quilt , Annie commemorated the trip to Korea she and Bryan had planned to pick up the twins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pampers <p> formula <p> ten-dollar bills <p> Travel : <p> 27 hours <p> 2 plane changes <p> 9 bottles water <p> 2 mini-bottles red wine <p> 2 sleeping pills <p> 11 bathrooms <p> 3 weeks in Korea ( unfamiliar as the moon ) <p> Except all this was imaginary , patched together from : <p> newspapers <p> TV <p> Internet chats <p> magazine articles in supermarket checkout lines <p> In real life , Annie and Bryan played it safe , paid an exorbitant amount -- highway robbery her mother said -- to have the twins delivered to JFK by adoption courier , a small neat woman with graying hair and an aura of calm , the epitome of a grandma . Here 's what Annie brought to the airport : <p> 2 car seats with pink gingham covers <p> Pampers , sizes 1 and 2 <p> 2 stuffed pandas ( a gift from her mother who seemed to think the girls were coming from China ) <p> 2 pairs of arms to hold her babies <p> And what she forgot : <p> Pampers newborns ( naturally , she guessed wrong ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for parents <p> extra pair of arms ( her mother 's , perhaps ? ) <p> " They 'll get used to us , " Bryan said that day , speeding home up I-95 , Annie in the back wedged between squalling wraiths in plastic seats . Hannah barfed , and Annie held out her hand to catch , nearly barfed herself . Then Esther pooped a yellow-green slime out her too-large diaper and down her legs , soaking the sleeper she 'd arrived in and her pretty gingham seat cover . <p> " What were we thinking ? " Annie cried . <p> " We 'll go one-on-one , " Bryan soothed . " Man-to-man defense . " <p> Then he swung into the Darien rest stop , carried Esther under her armpits to the men 's room , came back with her washed and swaddled in his T-shirt , her feet through the armholes , the big blue PENN upside down , PE up one leg , NN down the other . He stuck to the speed limit the rest of the way home , driving bare-chested , brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list below Bryan 's face on the quilt in front of Annie today : <p> 6 months ( how old the twins were when they came ) <p> 1 month ( how long they had Bryan for a Daddy ) <p> 2 years , 8 months , 11 days ( without Bryan ) <p> This is her attempt at facts , basic essentials , the truth . Except the minute she recorded the last -- in indelible ink -- it was already wrong , because it changes every day . What was that called back in high school algebra ? A variable , the number that always eluded her . <p> Around 9:15 a.m . A different man on TV now : <p> As we were about to exit the building through the turnstile , the security guard looks at me and says , " Where are you going ? " I said , " Well , I am going home . " " Why ? " " I saw fire-balls coming down . " " No , your building is safe and secure . Go back to your office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words he says . He 's looking straight into the camera , his face real , not an illusion of cyberspace . He must have gone home , must not have believed . Annie picks up a marker , pens safe next to Bryan 's face , secure , a list of important s words ... <p> semblance <p> story <p> sham <p> In the un-dining room , Hannah sleeps on the couch , wet thumb slipped out onto her chin . Esther has gone to pee ; Annie listens for the flush . <p> " I thought you were going out , " her mother says , second call of the morning . <p> " Then why do you keep calling ? " Annie takes a slug of OJ , bitter and sweet . How long has Esther been in the bathroom ? " Estie ? " she hollers . " You all right in there ? " Hannah rolls over on the couch . Big Bird 's squeaky voice worries about something on the kids ' TV . Esther has diarrhea sometimes , does n't allow help wiping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing 's wrong . I 'm hanging up now . " <p> " If you do n't want to talk , why do you keep picking up ? " Then , as if remembering who she 's talking to , " Do you want me to come over ? I could come . " She 's switched to her careful voice that makes babies sleep and repairmen come on time . <p> " Do n't come . " <p> Annie was alone that day , too , except for the girls . Alone is never quite the same after children . She 'd finally settled them into their swings in front of a Baby Einstein video , was just stepping into the shower when she heard the phone and ignored it , let the machine pick up . I 'm OK she heard Bryan say into the tape . Funny how any conversation that begins with I 'm OK must really mean I 'm not OK . By the time she reached the phone , there was only a dial tone and a trail of wet footprints across the carpet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same conflicting advice . " Is your TV on ? Do n't turn it on . Oh my God , did you see that ? Do n't watch . " And finally , " I 'll be there in five minutes , " even though on any other day the drive would take fifteen . <p> " What are you doing right this minute ? " her mother says now . <p> " Trying to work , but I 'm a little distracted . " <p> " By the TV , right ? " <p> " No , by you , Mom . Why are n't you working ? " Annie listens for the telltale tapping of her mother 's fingers on her kitchen-table laptop . " You 're not writing this down , are you ? " she says , " for one of your stories ? " <p> " Who 'd believe such a story ? " <p> The TV timeline , at first orderly , minute-by-minute , is now as chaotic and disorienting as when it really happened . The vodka in Annie 's orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce her skin when she least expects it . <p> By 9:30 a.m. , a number of civilians who had failed to reach the roof and could not descend because of intensifying smoke became trapped on the 105th floor . <p> But then : <p> At approximately 9:07 a.m. , two chiefs commenced operations in the South Tower lobby . <p> Then : <p> At 9:50 a.m. , a ladder company had made its way up to the 70th floor ... <p> And then , somehow : <p> At 9:06 a.m. , the NYPD Chief of Department instructed that no units were to land on the roof ... <p> And then : <p> At 9:37 A.M. , a civilian on the 106th floor of the South Tower reported to a 9-1-1 operator that a lower floor -- " 90-something floor " -- was collapsing . <p> Outside , a lawnmower roars past . To the gardener , today is just another Tuesday . Annie raises the TV volume . If she can hear better , perhaps the words will make sense . Next to Bryan 's face she begins marking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He overslept after being up with the girls ' croup <p> His train broke down outside Grand Central <p> He stayed in Connecticut that day for a job interview <p> Bryan had promised to switch jobs closer to home , but had n't gotten around to it yet . <p> 9:59. a.m . The South Tower has fallen , windows peeling down like runs on a stocking . There 's a smell of something burnt in the air -- last night 's macaroni and cheese ? In the background , Elmo 's voice signals Sesame Street is ending . <p> Hannah appears in the doorway . Annie mutes the sound , ca n't tear her eyes from the un-muted picture . <p> " Where 's Esther ? " Hannah inquires . <p> " In the bathroom . " If Annie looks at her , she 'll have to turn the TV off . <p> " No she 's not . " <p> " Yes she is . " <p> " I just peed . She 's not . " <p> " The upstairs bathroom ? " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glass . <p> " Later . " Annie gulps down what 's left of her drink . <p> " Front door 's open . " <p> If no one is in the house to see , does the picture flickering across the TV screen still exist ? <p> Annie is out the door , calling for Esther , before the needle she 's left swinging from its thread comes to rest . The lawnmower passes through the front yard , a thundering tractor trailing razor-edged blades spinning so fast you ca n't see them , but you know they 're there . Tom the gardener rides atop his perch , industrial earmuffs cradling his ears . " Esther ! " Annie shrieks , " Estieeeee ! " Tom does n't flinch , rides on past as if she does n't exist . <p> A tug on her robe and Annie scoops up Hannah . Before kids , could she have imagined the nearly weightless sensation of a sole three-year-old in her arms ? Hannah mouths words Annie ca n't hear , then touches a sticky hand to Annie 's cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Esther , two doors down , in Rita Rubin 's yard . Annie did n't know all the neighbors by name before that day . Rita Rubin has thinning hair , never the same after chemo , and a Chihuahua named Max . <p> Esther squats in Rita Rubin 's grass , a small brown boulder in white panties and undershirt . Intent on what she 's doing , she does n't see Annie and Hannah until they are upon her . She 's picking Rita Rubin 's fresh-planted pansies , plucking at the roots , counting ... four , five , a hundred ... " For you , Mommy , " she smiles , holding up a bouquet of velvety purple , yellow of the sun . <p> Bryan called twice that morning . Once to leave his I 'm OK message . A second time , which Annie grabbed on the first ring , to say he 'd gotten out , down all those stairs , but was going back up . " Do n't worry , " he said . " They said we 're safe here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie made her first list quilt two weeks later , on Yom Kippur , a list of sins her fellow congregants in temple recited aloud while symbolically beating their chests , asking God 's forgiveness : <p> For the sins we have committed against You with the <p> utterance of our lips <p> For the sins we have committed against You by <p> foolish speech <p> By deception and falsehood <p> By insincerity <p> By talebearing ... <p> Nearly three pages of sins , and more than a dozen involving words of the mouth . So many different ways to not tell the truth . Annie had sat in the pew next to her mother , Esther and Hannah squirming on her lap , unable to say the words . Then she went home and took out her fabric markers , began making a list . <p> 10:29 a.m . Annie carries Esther and Hannah home . " Hold on , " she says . They are heavy but balanced , arms wrapped around her neck . The sun glistens off the flat planes of their cheeks , the shiny black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are related to the Jews , the lost tribe . But then she also says Native Americans are the lost tribe . And she calls them Chinese and Indians because she 's just quoting her own grandmother , paying homage , not really believing . There 's truth , and then there 's story . <p> " Look , Mommy , " Esther says , letting go with one hand to point , as Tom the gardener rides his tractor up a ramp into the back of his truck . " Fuck ... one fuck , " she counts happily . <p> At just that moment Peggy the mail lady pulls up to deliver bills and catalogs into Annie 's box by the street ; she left a sinful chocolate cake in there one day back when everyone else was bringing casseroles . <p> Esther lets go with the other hand . Now she points with both hands , V for victory -- one towards Tom the gardener 's rig and the other , still clutching those pansies , at the postal truck . " Two fucks ! " she cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> Article copyright Lilith Publications , Inc . <p>

##1011869 Some things take lots of patience ! <p> He landed a small plane at the Mt . Forel spaceport , with a lot more runway than he needed . He 'd phoned ahead . I watched him for a while , making his way on foot along the three-kilometer path that leads down to the Draco Tavern . He took his sweet time , stopping to pan across the alien foliage with the video-camera bump on his forehead . When he stopped to rest , I went out to meet him . What the heck-the tavern was clean and in good repair and life was turning dull . This strip of land between the airlocks and the foothills is covered with strange plants , purple ground cover too dry to be moss , and big odd shapes that you might take for wind-shaped rocks . He was looking about him , delighted and a little awed , as he perched on one of the slow ones . This one looks like a rock wind-smoothed into the shape of an inverted boat . I was amused . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He was a blackhaired white American , medium height , with a smile that might have been ingratiating . The vid camera was a glittering dot on his forehead . " Matthew Taper . I 'm with CDC Network . I hope I wo n't keep you long . " " No problem . There are n't any ships in and I 've got lots of free time . " " Ah . Good . " He slid over to make room for me on the Type Two Slowlife . I sat . He had n't noticed a second invertedboat-shaped rock , this one 's mate , fifty meters further back . He pointed at a cube of clear yellow plastic set in the Draco Tavern 's wall . There was a shadow inside it : a dark aerodynamic shape like a large turtle with big clawed feet and a head partly retracted . Taper asked , " Is that an alien or a sculpture ? Or a hologram ? " " Alien , " I said . " Speedy , I 've been calling it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an airlock ? Made of jelly ? " " They 're all airlocks , that whole line along the front of the tavern . For Speedy , we 've got this block of plastic ... not jelly , just memory plastic soft enough to deform . He 'll walk through it , but slowly , and it wo n't lose air in either direction . " " How many aliens have you got in right now ? " " Ten . Six are in Argentina , hunting . " " But you have to feed the rest ? " " I meant on Earth . There 's nobody actually in the tavern . " Taper 's eyes defocused : he was consulting notes . " You got a lot more with the first liner , with Thrill seeker . Five species , twenty individuals . That first landing must have been a thrill a minute . " I waved it off . " Oh , you can find anything you want about the first one . Let me tell you about the second landing . " " Were n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them ... " That long ago , we did n't have much telescope coverage of the Moon . What we had was Spaceguard . Spaceguard was an effort by NASA and other political entities to track Near Earth Objects : that is , asteroid threats above one kilometer across . Map those and you might stand a chance of protecting the planet from a giant meteoroid impact . They 'd already found 90% of the candidates , they said . An object was found approaching the Moon 's dark limb . It blinked out as it entered the shadow . Another sky watcher caught the flare of what might have been its drive , but turned out to be riding lights . The skywatching community began talking to each other . Hundreds had it in view when the chirpsithra liner settled into orbit around the Moon , and they did n't tell a single disaster control office or newsman for nearly ten hours . They 'd done this once before , with an incoming asteroid that turned out to be a false alarm . Skywatchers talked to each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication just had n't been established . But now the world was watching , and everything happened too slowly . The mile-wide soap bubble drifted in orbit around the Moon . A smaller boat budded loose and drifted toward Earth . It eased down through the atmosphere , taking more hours , following force field lines down to Earth 's magnetic pole . It settled at Mount Forel in Siberia , where the first ship 's boat had touched down the previous year . Everything we saw came via orbital cameras ; it was hours before camera crews could get on site . We saw aliens eleven feet tau and very slender , plated with dull red armor : the same chirpsithra species who had crewed the first ship . They emerged from the lander and began landscaping . Taper asked , " Was the Draco Tavern in place yet ? " " No , I had backers and a site , but there was nothing on it but posts and string . " " Pity . So what do you mean , landscaping ? " " That 's what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirt and alien fertilizer . I was one of the first on site , and I could smell that chemical reek . " Cameras showed up , and newspersons , and UN officials . The chirpsithra went about their business . They planted some weird alien trees in the soil they 'd made , and then some structures that they brought out on big float plates . Like Japanese landscaping , we thought . " " I 'll run those records after I get home . " Taper waved around us . " Is this what you 're talking about ? This whole three or four square miles looks like alien gardening . " " Yeah . Those bigger trees were planted as saplings . Most of this layered mosslike stuff grew up over the next few years . The slow ones were already in place . There was plenty for the herbivores by the time they got hungry . " The chirps talked to me about the interspecies tavern I wanted to build . We settled on where to put it-right at the edge of the cultivated stretch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and those were the first pieces of the Draco Tavern . They played diplomat and gave some interviews , and then they left . " Taper was having trouble catching up . " Slow ones ? " " Originally there were a dozen , " I said . " Six little half-eggs must have been food animals . They did n't move fast enough , and the Type One , Speedy , rolled over them and ate them during the first six or seven years . Two of the others went home on the next ship after snuffling around Siberia on tractors . They were the fastest . " After they left , Speedy was making visible progress toward the airlocks . It 's taken him twenty-six years to get into the jelly lock . He 'll be inside before Christmas . These others-do you see that tree stump with an indented top ? There 's water in the top , a little pond of his own , but you ca n't see that . He 's the slowest . These boat-shaped- " " Yeek ! " He rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mind . I know them all pretty well . You can talk to them with electronic mail- " " They can use computers ? " " Sure , all of these slow ones are intelligent tool users . The computers they build work as fast as ours . To the slow ones , they 're instantaneous . To talk to them , you just trade letters . It does n't matter how slow they write . " I watched him working out how useless that would be to a newsman . I said , " Of course they need terrific protection against spam . Otherwise- " " Yeah . What do they talk like ? " " Here . " I fished out my translator and whispered a few instructions . It projected a screen , watery looking in the horizontal sunlight . HELLO ! I SEEK A COMPANION . I AM RICK SCHUMANN , HUMAN , HOPING TO BECOME A BARTENDER . CALL ME QUIZZICAL . HI , QUIZZICAL . IS THAT YOUR STRUCTURE BEING ERECTED ON THE TUNDRA ? YES , THAT 'S THE DRACO TAVERN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BUT IT HAS STOOD FOR SOMETIME . THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE TWO YEARS BACK . WE FIXED IT . I HOPE TO SEE THE INSIDE SOON . IT MUTATES LIKE DREAMS . BE WELCOME.THE JELLY LOCK IS FOR SLOW ONES . I SEE IT . SPEEDY IS ALMOST THERE . I SEE A FLUTTERING THAT MUST BE YOUR KIND 'S TRAFFIC . DO YOU KNOW THE CHIRPSITHRA ? THEY LIVE TOO FAST TO BE TRULY KNOWN , BUT THEY DO N'T DIE TOO SOON.AT LEAST WE MAY CONVERSE . ONE , KTATH Taper scowled . " Is that all ? " " Yeah . Quizzical is the Type Three , the one like a tree stump . " " Twenty-six years ? " " Understand , Mr. Taper , most of my visitors use oxidizing chemistry . Some are even faster than chirps and humans . One type burns like a fire . She was born in the tavern , and I only got to know her for a few hours . But that 's not the only way to live . " Reducing chemistry is very slow compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They watched the Draco Tavern grow up in front of them . They 'll see it turn to dust . They 'll be here a long time . " Taper rapped what I was sitting on . " This shell- " " They 're in pressure suits . So 's Speedy . They have to be protected from oxygen . " " They 're all streamlined , " he noted . " Even that tree stump has a teardrop silhouette , " turning his camera on Quizzical . I said , " Just being a slow one would n't slow down weather . Comes a hurricane , or a flood , they 'd just have to wait it out . " Taper asked , " May I talk to Speedy ? " " I 'll give you his e-mail address . Have you got a story now ? Or is it all too slow ? " " May I have the other e-mail addresses ? " " I 'll ask first . " Taper came back in January . This time he hurried through Siberia 's endless freezing night to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia in winter is n't a habitable planet . The tavern was crowded ; a liner was in . He stood there taking it in for a few minutes , recording with the camera on his forehead . Then he hung up some of his gear and wove his way through the crowd and the divergent environments . Speedy was past the jelly lock and ten centimeters inside . Taper smiled down at the smoothed-out turtle shape . He ran a hand over Speedy 's head . Then he fished out a keyboard and began typing . I was at his elbow . " How 's it going , Mr. Taper ? Got a story yet ? " He laughed . " Not today . If I made a lifetime project of this , I might have something to show the execs . Mr. Schumann , this does n't take every minute of my time . I 've kept four interviews going for seven months without ever skipping lunch . When I 'm an old man , these guys could save my reputation . " " This last ship , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addresses ? " " They have n't logged in yet . Come back in the summer and I 'll introduce you .

##1011950 A nervous man visits the country to relax . But are those ghosts he sees in the window ? Find out in this classic tale of terror-with a twist ! <p> BASED ON A STORY BY SAKI " My aunt will be down presently , Mr. Nuttel , " said Vera , a self-possessed young lady of 15 . " In the meantime , you must try and put up with me . " Framton Nuttel tried to think of the correct thing to say . " Do you know many of the people " round here ? " asked Vera . " Hardly a soul , " said Framton . " My sister stayed here , you know , four years ago . She got acquainted with your aunt , Mrs. Sappleton . " " Then you know practically nothing about my aunt ? " pursued the young lady . " Only her name and address , " admitted the caller . He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was married or widowed . Something about the room suggested a manly presence . " Her great tragedy happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be since your sister 's time . " " Her tragedy ? " asked Framton warily . He was visiting the countryside to recover from a nervous ailment . " You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon , " said the niece , indicating a large French window that opened onto a lawn . " It is quite warm for the time of year , " said Framton . " But what has that window got to do with the tragedy ? " " Out through that window , three years ago today , my aunt 's husband and two young brothers went off for their day 's shooting . They never came back . In crossing the moor , they were all engulfed in a muddy bog . It had been a wet summer , you know , and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning . Their bodies were never recovered . " Here the girl 's voice lost its confident note . " My poor aunt always thinks that they will come back someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and walk in that window just as they used to do . That is why the window is kept open every evening until dusk . " My aunt has often told me how they went out , her husband with his white coat over his arm , and Ronnie , her young brother , singing , " Bertie , why do you bound ? " as he always did to tease her . Do you know , sometimes on still , quiet evenings like this , I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window . " She broke off with a little shudder . It was a relief to Framton when her aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late . " I hope Vera has been amusing you ? " she said . " She has been very interesting , " said Framton uneasily . " I hope you do n't mind the open window , " said Mrs. Sappleton briskly . " My husband and brothers will be home directly , and they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marshes today , so they 'll make a fine mess over my carpets . So like you menfolk , is n't it ? " She rattled on cheerfully about the hunting season . To Framton , it was pure horror . He tried to turn the talk to a less ghastly topic ; he began describing his recent illness . But he realized that his poor hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention . Her eyes kept straying past him to the open window . It was so unfortunate that he had come to visit on this tragic anniversary . " The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest , no excitement , and the avoidance of physical exercise , " continued Framton , who was regrettably one of those people convinced that everyone was interested in all the details of his ailments . Mrs. Sappleton turned toward the window and suddenly brightened . " Here they are at last ! " she cried . " Just in time for tea , and do n't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes . In shock , Framton swung around in his seat and looked in the same direction . In the deepening twilight , three figures were walking across the lawn . They carried guns under their arms , and one of them had a white coat hung over his shoulders . A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels . Noiselessly they neared the house , and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk : " I said , Bertie , why do you bound ? " Framton grabbed wildly for his hat and raced out the hall door toward the front gate . A cyclist on the road had to run into the hedge to avoid a collision . " Here we are , my dear , " said the bearer of the white coat , coming in through the window , " fairly muddy , but most of it 's dry . Who was that who bolted out as we came up ? " " A most eccentric man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only talk about his illnesses , and dashed off without a goodbye . One would think he had seen a ghost . " " I expect it was the spaniel , " said the niece calmly . " He told me he had a horror of dogs . He was once pursued by a pack , and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and foaming just above him . Enough to make anyone lose their nerve .
