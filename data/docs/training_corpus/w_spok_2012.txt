Profits are up at companies like Ford , so we asked the man in the driver 's seat why not hire ? @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: With businesses holding on to a trillion dollars worth of cash , what are you waiting for ? @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: Jim Axelrod is on Cape Cod where they 're trying to solve a mystery . Why are the dolphins stranding themselves ? And " On the Road " with Steve Hartman . A man who 's lived by the golden rule gets something priceless in return . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!STEVE-HARTMAN-CBS: You ca n't buy the love that people have poured out for dad . @!ANNOUNCER: This is the CBS EVENING NEWS with Scott Pelley. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: Good evening , the latest report on the economy today looks like welcome news . It shows that the economy was growing in the final three months of last year at an annual rate of 2.8 percent . That 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not enough to make a big dent in unemployment , and it 's not the best we 've done since the great recession . The left side of this graph is 2007 and you see how far economic growth fell by 2008 . The best showing that we 've had was the beginning of 2010 . After that growth tanked again . 2011 was all about a slow struggle to get back . Where are the strengths and the weaknesses going forward ? We asked Anthony Mason to show us. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Oh , yeah . Full reclining seats . @!ANTHONY-MASON-CBS: Much of the growth at the end of the year was due to strong auto sales . Terry D'Arcy , a GM dealer in Joliet , Illinois , just had his best fourth quarter in five years . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I can really feel the momentum coming . @!MASON-@1on-camera@: Do you feel like we 're out of the woods finally ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I would n't say we 're out of the woods but I do n't think we 're going backwards , I do n't think we 're sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also has a Hyundai and Volkswagen dealership . @(on-camera) : What are you seeing ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: We 're seeing the people a lot more confident making a big purchase so they 're not as afraid to come in and buy something out , a big ticket like this . @(voice-over) : That 's given D'Arcy the confidence to break ground on a third dealership . @(on-camera) : Does that mean more jobs ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Yes . We 're going to add -- we 're going to add about another 45 jobs when we make that transition . @!MASON-@1voice-over: Overall , the economy grew at its fastest rate in a year and a half . But much of that growth was fueled by businesses restocking inventories . @(on-camera) : This number is not as strong as it looks then ? @!DIANE-SWONK: It 's not as strong as it looks and still below what people had hoped , so , you know , the reality is that the economy is still struggling . @!MASON-@1voice-over: Economist Diane Swonk at Chicago 's Mesirow Financial says the biggest head wind is still the gridlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much of a political strategist to forecast the economy . @!MASON-@1on-camera@: So , do you think politics is just freezing this economy ? @!SWONK: I think politics is a major negative on this economy and everyone from leaders in Europe to leaders in the Middle East to leaders in China , leaders in the U.S. are all to blame . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!MASON: The rancor and indecision in Washington , Swonk says , are discouraging businesses from making investments or hiring . @!PELLEY: Anthony , a point that came up in the newsroom today is that growth is sluggish even though interest rates have been at historic lows for a very long time . @!MASON: Scott , you can - you can look at this two ways , I think . The first is remember the economy looked like it was on the brink of a recession last summer , so 2.8 percent growth now looks pretty good . On the other hand , it 's not nearly enough to put a dent in the unemployment rate . The fact is the economy is actually producing more now than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that businesses have figured out how to do that with about 6 million fewer workers . @!PELLEY: Anthony , thank you very much . Wall Street was n't all that impressed today . The Dow closed down 74 points . But if you take the longer view , stocks are off to a very good start this year , up more than 3.5 percent . And have a look at this . The Dow has gained nearly 19 percent since tanking last year during the European debt crisis . Stock prices have nearly doubled since hitting bottom during the financial crisis . The Ford Motor Company today reported the highest fourth quarter profits in its history . Net income of more than $13 billion . Most of that , though , was because of a one-time change in Ford 's accounting . Ford 's CEO is Alan Mulally , he spent most of his career as an engineering at Boeing . Mulally led the design of the giant 777 . He took over Ford in 2006 and mortgaged the company to borrow enough money to transform it . We sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive with their big reserves of cash . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: At this moment banks are holding on to about a trillion dollars in cash . Trillion with a " T. " Businesses are holding on to about a trillion dollars in cash . And yet , we do n't make much headway in unemployment . Why not ? @!ALAN-MULALLY-CEO , : Well , I think that there 's general agreement with the economists that until we get the growth rate , the expansion of the GDP , of our economic engine up over 3 -- 3.5 percent that that 's what is required to bring down the unemployment . @!PELLEY: But people want to know with businesses holding on to a trillion dollars worth of cash , what are you waiting for ? Why are n't we creating jobs ? @!MULALLY: Well , what 's happening right now is that customers are concerned , they 're not quite sure where we 're going as a country , and so they 're very concerned about making the purchases that they would normally consider . In the automobile industry , in Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 11 years old and people really do want these new fuel-efficient vehicles , but until they start to get some confidence that they know where we 're going as a country that they 're going to have a job , we 're going to be growing , it 's going to be very hard for them to make those big decisions . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: Ford never took a taxpayer bailout , but GM and Chrysler did and last week GM reclaimed the title of top-selling car company in the world . So we wondered if the bailout money has been paid back . We called the Treasury today and they tell us that all of the bailouts together came to $414 billion . Today $96 billion is yet to be paid back . The insurance company AIG still owes more than 51 billion and General Motors owes more than 25 billion . Ally Financial , which used to be GM 's finance company , owes taxpayers nearly another $12 billion . The Republican presidential candidates have made an issue of those bailouts -- among many other things . Their next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows Mitt Romney with a nine- point lead over Newt Gingrich. 38 percent to 29 percent . At their latest debate last night , the two went out at each other over immigration , so we decided to take a closer look at how they would deal with this hot-button issue . First , Dean Reynolds in Miami with the Gingrich campaign . Dean ? @!DEAN-REYNOLDS-CBS: Scott , Newt Gingrich does n't back one big comprehensive approach , instead , he backs a series of laws , which he believes could solve illegal immigration in three to five years . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!REYNOLDS: Mr. Speaker , what 's your plan on illegal immigration ? @!NEWT-GINGRICH: I would start with control of the border by January 1 , 2014. @!REYNOLDS: And you would control the border by building the fence ? @!GINGRICH: I 'd control the border by taking whatever steps were necessary . @!REYNOLDS-@1voice-o: He says those steps would include round-the- clock drone flights to monitor activity , better communication between state and federal agencies , but not necessarily a border-long fence . @!GINGRICH: If you have a straight cliff that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankly , if you have a river and you patrol it right , the river should be the fence . @!REYNOLDS: He would also make it easier to deport immigrants who commit crimes . Gingrich 's plan calls for modernization of the visa process to allow easier entry for students and guest workers and he would impose stiff penalties for any employer hiring undocumented workers . Gingrich is against blanket amnesty that would give legal status to undocumented residents already in the country , but he would give leeway to one specific group , those who have been here a long time with deep ties in their communities . They would come before a citizen review panel that could bestow legal residency , but not citizenship . @!GINGRICH: I do n't want to take grandmothers and grandfathers away from their families . And I do n't think the American people will do it . @!REYNOLDS-@1on-came: You understand why they come , though , right ? @!GINGRICH: Sure . They come because this is the most successful society in the world , the greatest opportunity for freedom on the planet and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: Now , Gingrich would also make English the official government language , Scott , and he would require a mastery of more American history as one qualification for citizenship . @!PELLEY: Dean , thanks very much . Now , what would Mitt Romney do ? Jan Crawford is in Miami covering his campaign . Jan ? @!JAN-CRAWFORD-CBS-: Well , Scott , Romney is taking a hard line on illegal immigration and today he was addressing a group of Hispanic leaders here in Miami and he tackled the issue head on . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!MITT-ROMNEY: I like immigration . I like legal immigration . @!CRAWFORD: To stop illegal immigration , Romney would secure the border with a 2,600 mile fence and deploy enough agents to patrol it . @!ROMNEY: We will stop the flow of illegal immigration into this country . I 'm convinced of that . @!CRAWFORD: Romney would make it harder for illegal immigrants to get work by requiring employers to verify their status and face fines for hiring undocumented workers . He opposes programs that he says reward illegal immigrants like those that allow them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As governor of Massachusetts , he blocked a similar program in the state . But where Romney differs most sharply from Newt Gingrich is how he would handle the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country . He believes they should return to their home countries and get in line behind those waiting to come here legally and says many will do so voluntarily if they ca n't find jobs here . @!ROMNEY: Other people call that self-deportation . My point is we 're not going to go around and round people up in buses and ship them home . Instead we 'll let people make their own decisions based upon their employment opportunities here -- or lack thereof if they do n't have a valid work authorization card . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!CRAWFORD: Now , the battle over this issue obviously has been intense , especially here in Florida . Gingrich this week had a radio ad accusing Romney of being anti-immigrant but then , Scott , Senator Marco Rubio came out and said that was inflammatory and false , so Gingrich quickly pulled it . @!PELLEY: Election day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the University of Michigan today taking aim at the skyrocketing cost of a college education . He threatened to take away federal aid from schools that keep raising tuition and give the money to the schools that hold the line . The president ca n't do that without approval from Congress , however . One year after the uprising in Egypt women still face brutal abuse from the authorities . What is fair compensation for the survivors of the cruise ship disaster ? And saving the dolphins on Cape Cod . When the CBS EVENING NEWS continues . @!PELLEY: A year after the revolution in Egypt , the people who forced a dictator from power still do n't have the freedom or human rights they demanded . The military is in charge and this week demonstrators returned to the streets . Clarissa Ward in Cairo reports that many of the protesters are women who have been sexually assaulted by Egyptian soldiers . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!CLARISSA-WARD-CBS: Samira Ibrahim 's memories of Tahrir Square are not just of the revolution . During a military raid there last March which was captured on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by security forces . @(on-camera) : From your hair ? @!WARD-@1voice-over@: " They insulted us and beat us " she said " then shocked us with electric prods . " @(on-camera) : Were you with your friends ? @(voice-over) : Her story of what followed has rocked Egypt . " They ordered us to undress completely and split us into two groups " she told us . Ibrahim says she was forced to lie on a table and undergo a virginity test -- in full view of a group of soldiers , some of whom she said filmed the assault . @(on-camera) : How did you feel in that moment ? Did you feel helpless ? @!WARD-@1voice-over@: She told us that the military called her a prostitute and said the test is meant to humiliate women and scare them away from protesting . 19 female protesters have reported being subjected to virginity tests since the military regime took over from ousted leader Hosni Mubarak last February . This video shows a young woman being beaten and stripped by soldiers . She 's known only as " the woman with the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was assaulted and had her arms broken by security forces last November . She says very few women in Egypt speak out about sexual assault because of the cultural and religious importance attached to chastity . @!MONA-ELTAHAWY: Women are expected to be ashamed about what happened to them and just quietly go home . @!WARD: But Ibrahim was not willing to suffer in silence . She went to civil court to have the practice declared illegal and she won . To many here , she is a hero . @!ELTAHAWY: And she 's going to become an icon of this revolution not just for women , but for men , too . Because she 's looking those old generals in the eye and she 's saying " The shame belongs to you , not to me . " And that is revolutionary . @!WARD: Ibrahim is now gearing up towards her next battle . She wants those responsible to be punished in a military court . " I refuse to be afraid , " she said . " this is n't just for me , it 's for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cairo . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: In Iraq , fear is growing that the two main branches of Islam are heading toward an all out civil war . In Baghdad today , 33 people were killed when a suicide bomber possibly linked to al-Qaeda attacked a funeral procession . More than 200 people have been killed in Iraq since the last American troops left last month . Catch and release . Tracking rescued dolphins off Cape Cod . Next . @!PELLEY: Marine biologists are on alert on Cape Cod tonight . They are watching the beaches in case any more dolphins need to be rescued . Nearly a hundred have stranded themselves over the last two weeks -- a lot more than usual so early in the year and no one is quite sure why . We sent Jim Axelrod to the Cape in search of answers . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!JIM-AXELROD-CBS-C: At the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod ... @!MISTY-NIEMEYER: Center blow hole is 28. @!AXELROD: Marine biologist Misty Niemeyer is trying to solve the mystery of why dozens of dolphins are stranding themselves . @!NIEMEYER: It could be cyclical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year than they have in the past years . It 's really hard to say . @!AXELROD: The mass stranding started two weeks ago along a 25-mile stretch of Cape Cod . 98 dolphins in all -- as many as this area usually sees in an entire year . Two dozen were saved . Fitted with transmitters and released back into the water . Brian Sharp of the International Fund for Animal Welfare is following their signals . These lines show three survivors have made it up to Maine . @(on-camera) : This means they 're alive and thriving ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: That - that is correct . If the tag is transmitting that the animal is alive . @!AXELROD-@1voice-ov: There are a few theories about what 's behind the strandings . Dolphins are social animals and could be following a disoriented leader . Their food supply may be too close to shore . It may even have something to do with the unusually mild winter . @!NIEMEYER: One , two , three . @!AXELROD-Niemeyer-h# @!NIEMEYER: We would like to see every animal that comes in alive to go back out alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: We 're going to start to get junior in here . @!AXELROD: Although 200 more dolphins have been spotted off the coast , there have been no new strandings since Monday . Scientists hope they 'll find some answers before they find more dolphins on Cape Cod beaches . Jim Axelrod , CBS News , Woods Hole , Massachusetts . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: How do you put a price tag on the suffering of passengers who survived that Italian cruise ship disaster ? Well , the ship 's operator is offering them about $14,000 each if they do n't sue . Costa cruises has also offered the passengers a full refund . At least 16 people were killed in the accident two weeks ago . Tonight 16 others are still missing . What happens when you spend your life planting seeds of good will ? You get an incredible harvest . " On the Road " with Steve Hartman is next . @!PELLEY: Finally tonight in the Pacific northwest , in a small town east of Portland there is a man who has spent his entire life helping his neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steve Hartman found this story " On the Road " in Corbett , Oregon . @(BEGINV-VIDEOTAPE) @!STEVE-HARTMAN-CBS: On a high ridge above the Columbia River just down from heaven you 'll find an angel on a front end loader . Woody Davis is kind of a jack of all trades . And although he 's never made much money at it , by all accounts he has earned his wings . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: He 's the epitome of something dear . @!HARTMAN-@1on-camer: Did he always get paid for everything you did ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I would n't say that . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: You 'd have to chase him down to pay him sometimes . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I made a check out and stuck it in his pocket . You ca n't hand it to him . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: He 's uncommon . He 's special , he 's a gift that this community has had all these years . @!HARTMAN: Which is why folks here in Corbett , Oregon , are now going out of their way to thank Woody for the thousands of good deeds he 's done for them . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut and stack his firewood for winter . A couple guys fixed up his old pickup truck . Someone even built him a beautiful wood box and invited the whole town to sign it . Did you know how much the community cared for him ? This is Woody 's son Clint . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Not to the degree I do now . @!HARTMAN: He says all the work his dad did for people has been repaid tenfold. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Bill Gates could not come to Corbett and buy this . You ca n't buy the love that people have poured out for dad . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: We 'll keep praying for you . @!HARTMAN: Their words and deeds are sincere and lasting . Unfortunately , the box is pine , and the outlook is n't good . A few months ago , Woody was diagnosed with ALS , Lou Gehrig 's disease . Doctors tell him he has about six months .

Did you just say that you feel blessed you 're dying slowly ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Yeah , because people -- @!HARTMAN: " Because people have a chance to express to me how they feel , " he said . You know , in most communities death is whispered . Praise saved for the eulogy. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Wow . @!HARTMAN: But Woody Davis and the people of Corbett show us why that may be too late .

##4103551 @!GAYLE-KING: Hello , Dallas , Texas . Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING . We begin this half hour with a story about a type of car insurance fraud that 's hitting an all-time high . @!ERICA-HILL: In Florida , authorities say consumers pay an extra billion dollars a year because of it . Chief investigative correspondent Armen Keteyian shows us how scam artists collect using fake car crashes . @(Begin-VT) @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: In Tampa , security cameras captured an accident . An SUV slammed into a car . But rewind the tape and you see it 's no accident . Instead , the car was driven into the middle of the street . The driver gone out , a collision , and then five people climbed into the damaged vehicle . The passengers later claim they 'd been injured . The start of a scam to rip off their car insurance company . @!RON-POINDEXTER-@1N: They are organized and an ongoing criminal enterprise , racketeering to defraud insurance companies out of millions of dollars through an ongoing scheme . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Today , twelve states have what 's known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at fault , everyone involved in an auto accident is entitled to insurance money , if they 're hurt . In Florida , it 's up to ten thousand dollars a person ; in New York , fifty thousand . Opening a door for scammers like this man who asked we conceal his identity . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Why this scam ? Is it -- is it because it 's just so easy ? @!MAN-# 1 : I just because it 's easy money like that . And it 's a lot of money . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Here 's how it works . It 's run by organizers who own bogus medical clinics . They in turn hire recruiters , who find people willing to stage accidents for money . The people involved are then taken to phony clinics. @(Man-#-2-speaking-f @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: This undercover video of Florida State investigator posing as an accident victim was told to sign form after form for medical treatment he 'll never receive . He 's then paid seven hundred dollars in cash for faking an accident and injury . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Is it always the same thing ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah , that 's why it was so easy . No matter what you do , you 're going to back problem . @!RON-POINDEXTER: It 's very organized . In -- in Tampa , especially , there 's one organization that allegedly controls fifty or sixty clinics with a hierarchy of people who own the clinics down to people who are staging accidents , participants . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Investigators say crooked clinic owners can rake in as much as two million dollars a year . These scammers were arrested and convicted of staging a car accident . @(End-VT) @!GAYLE-KING: And Armen Keteyian is with us now . Hello and welcome . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Good morning . @!GAYLE-KING: I 'm always so surprised that people are n't aware there 's cameras everywhere , duh. @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Duh. @!GAYLE-KING: Why do people think they can get away with it ? @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Well , because they are n't -- @!GAYLE-KING: They do ? @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: -- getting away with it , Gayle. @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: I mean , this is amazing . You have just that one there that we saw , you know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: In the -- in the other cases , they actually go up to a stop sign or go to a light , somebody will flash their lights , which is the signal to start the scam . Somebody will run into them . Everybody in the car -- if you have five people in the car in Florida , that 's potentially fifty thousand dollars . And you have doctors and you have lawyers and you have chiropractors and massage therapists all in on this stuff , because the insurance companies have to pay within thirty days in Florida . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm. @!ERICA-HILL: Wow , it 's so extensive , the network of people to pull this off . Do n't you , though , have to call the police when you have an accident ? I mean , would n't that stop this scam ? @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: No . I think , actually , it starts the scam . Because you have an actual police report that then that -- @!GAYLE-KING: Oh , okay . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: -- you can file with the insurance companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people are just going online downloading forms for a police accident , filling them out and then taking them to these fake clinics. @!ERICA-HILL: Without ever having the accident ? @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Without ever having the accident . They do n't even -- @!ERICA-HILL: Oh , it 's so much easier . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: I know , is n't it ? I mean it 's amazing . Six hundred and fifty million there and , you know , New York and Michigan , it 's -- it 's rampant there as well . @!GAYLE-KING: Well , hopefully they saw you this morning and they 'll rethink that little strategy . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: Thank you , Armen . Thank you . @!ARMEN-KETEYIAN: You 're welcome . @!GAYLE-KING: Moving now from fraud to murder , tomorrow 's 48 HOURS MYSTERY has a story about forbidden young love that ends with a mother 's killing . @!ERICA-HILL: Richard Schlesinger reports now on how investigators had to answer a tough question -- did the victim 's daughter really do it ? @(Begin-VT) @!MAN: You 've been arrested for murder . @!TYLAR-WITT: What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!TYLAR-WITT: What ? My mom 's dead ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: This is fourteen-year-old Tyler Witt . She and her nineteen-year-old boyfriend , Steven Colver , were charged with killing Tyler 's mother , Joanne , in June of 2009 . Joanne was a single mother who lived with Tyler in Eldorado Hills , California . Prosecutor Lisette Suder said the killing was especially vicious . @!LISETTE-SUDER-@1Pr: Joanne had twenty stab wounds over her entire body . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The crime of matricide , when a child kills his or her mother is extremely rare . And Tyler vehemently denied killing her mother . @!TYLAR-WITT: I want an attorney . I want you gone . How dare you ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tyler eventually admitted she planned her mother 's murder but insisted Steven did the stabbing . He says she did it . But prosecutors believe Tylar. @!LISETTE-SUDER: You asked why I ultimately believed her . All the other evidence in the case that we have independently supports what she says . @(End-VT) @!ERICA-HILL: Tylar Witt made a deal to testify against her boyfriend in exchange for a lighter sentence . Richard Slessinger is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . @!ERICA-HILL: -- little disturbing ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Yes , it 's not great . @!ERICA-HILL: No , you mentioned -- you mention matricide is -- is rare . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It is quite rare . @!ERICA-HILL: Are there -- are there numbers on this , even if there is a science ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Yeah , they are . They 're just starting to collect numbers . You know , this -- unfortunate , this is one area of crime that 's growing . In the latest figures , were available from 2008 , two hundred and sixty mothers were -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mm. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- were murdered that year . Those are the latest figures . The thing that 's disturbing is that while other types of crime are going down , this is rising as a percentage of family crimes . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And so people are really starting to look at it . @!GAYLE-KING: Well , as a mother , you too , Erica -- @!ERICA-HILL: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: -- we 're glad to hear that the numbers are rare . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: But is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Well , this is -- @!GAYLE-KING: They have a breakdown on that ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- this is amazing thing . This is why we are so interested in this case . It 's -- it 's extremely rare for daughters to kill their mothers . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: I think the figures are -- the figures are seven to one -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- boys versus girls . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: So not only is matricide very rare , but the incidence of daughters killing their mothers is even rarer . @!ERICA-HILL: And -- and I have to mention one of the things they look at is , they look at these numbers is why that 's its going up . I mean , is there anything specific they can point to , yet ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: That -- you know what , this is also new . I mean , they -- they think it has to do with , you know , stress and -- but this is what criminologists always say before they really know what -- what -- what there- - @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know is that it 's rising . They do know that these crimes are typically , unbelievably violent . I mean , Joanne Witt was stabbed -- @!GAYLE-KING: Twenty times . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- twenty times . I did this story a couple of -- about a year ago , another matricide in Memphis , where the mother was stabbed fifty times . @!ERICA-HILL: Oh , my God . @!GAYLE-KING: Wow . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: So they 're looking at that too . It 's a -- @!GAYLE-KING: I do n't know , Richard . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Not exactly -- @!GAYLE-KING: I 've had enough of that . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Yeah , sorry to bring down your morning . But it 's an important -- @!ERICA-HILL: But it 's -- @!GAYLE-KING: Really good to see you . @!ERICA-HILL: Yeah , great to see you . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Yeah . Always fun , is n't it . But -- but it 's an important -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- issue that they 're looking at . So -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah , yeah . I -- I watch every Saturday . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- it 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: There will be a quiz . @!ERICA-HILL: And when you -- and when you watch this Saturday , Richard 's full report will be airing on 48 HOURS MYSTERY . That 's tomorrow night at ten , nine Central , right here on CBS . It is tough to imagine Broadway without Andrew Lloyd Webber . And he 's here with us this morning in Studio 57 . We 'll talk about twenty-five years of Phantom of the Opera and the next chapter in that saga . But , first , here 's your local weather . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!GAYLE-KING: Do you know the music ? A little more than twenty-five years ago , a musical about a disfigured , mysterious genius opened in London . Today , Phantom of the Opera is the longest-running show in Broadway history . Its creator , Andrew Lloyd Webber , is with us this morning . But before we meet him , Betty Nguyen takes a look at his remarkable career . @(Begin-VT) @(Excerpt-from-the-P @!BETTY-NGUYEN: A famous line from one of theater 's most famed productions . @(Excerpt-from-the-P @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Written , produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WO@!MAN-# 1 : He 's a real perfectionist which can be a pain for some people . But I happen to like that . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: And so do millions of fans and critics around the world . Webber 's shows have won seven Tonys , three Grammys , an Oscar and a Golden Globe . Over four decades , he 's transformed musical theater . Webber 's initial success came in the 1970s with the Broadway productions of Jesus Christ Superstar . @(Excerpt-from-the-J @!BETTY-NGUYEN: And Evita. @(Excerpt-from-Evita @!BETTY-NGUYEN: In the ' 80s , he created Cats . @(Excerpt-from-Cats, @!SEAN-FLAHAVEN-@1NY: Prior to Cats really a successful Broadway show would run for two , three , four years . Cats , running for eighteen years is really unprecedented . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Until of course the phantom came to town . Now in its twenty- fourth year on Broadway , The Phantom of the Opera is known as the most successful piece of entertainment of all-time . One hundred thirty million people have seen it to the tune of 5.6 billion revenue . @!SEAN-FLAHAVEN: It becomes a destination as opposed to just a show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see the show , Webber 's music of the night may find you . Betty Nguyen , CBS News , New York . @(Excerpt-from-the-P @(End-VT) @!CHARLIE-ROSE: We do n't often get to introduce a guest this way , but Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber is here . Welcome . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Hi , good morning . @!GAYLE-KING: Welcome . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: What is it that you have that other people do n't have ? What is this genius that enables you to do this kind of work that so resonates with the public ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I ca n't really answer that question . I mean , I -- I 'm just very lucky . I love musical theater . And I 'm -- I 'm very lucky really that I 've been able to make a career out of it . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: You buy that , Gayle ? @!GAYLE-KING: No , Charlie -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: I did n't . I didn't. @!GAYLE-KING: I was just going to say . I 'm thinking -- I 'm thinking Andrew Lloyd Webber , it 's a little more than luck . Would it embarrass you to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen Phantom nine times , nine times . And every time I go to see it , I get something different . But I 'm told I 'm not alone , a lo -- you have a lot of repeat customers that go to see Phantom . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Oh , yeah , there -- there are a lot of people who -- I think they -- they 're crazy , I think . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I mean , that some change their -- @!GAYLE-KING: you think I 'm crazy ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: -- change their name to Christine Daae , like @(INDISTINCT) @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: -- it 's a -- it 's -- it 's a little bit strange to me but I 'm like , it 's -- The Phantom has been extraordinary . And you know I 've been very , very lucky . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Does that make it your favorite of all these things ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: You know , I 'm always asked , you know , what 's my favorite ? @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Right , of course . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I think the truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're a little bit like your children . @!GAYLE-KING: Hard to pick a -- hard to pick a favorite . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: It really is hard to pick one . And there 's a -- Jesus Christ Superstar , I 'm very happy there 's a very , very good production of that that 's coming to Broadway which started off in Stratford , Ontario . And I 'm pleased about that because I never -- never really liked the Broadway production of Superstar before . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Why not ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I 'm like -- @(INDISTINCT) than years ago . I just -- I just thought it was completely alien to what I 'd really intended . I always wanted Superstar to be quite gritty and to be and -- and @(INDISTINCT) wants to be set in that Square in Egypt , we keep seeing on TV. @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I mean , and -- and I think what Des McAnuff 's done with his production is he has given it that edge . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah , it 's good . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Which I -- I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Oh , yes , hundreds of times . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Failed -- @(Cross-talking) @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Yes . Yes , I mean , the Love Never Dies in London did n't work . But I 'm very happy to say that it has worked very , very well in Australia . I think the -- the fine line between success and failure in musical theater is terribly small sometimes . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: If you think about it , I mean , say Chicago that failed first time out . And it was in the same season as Chorus Line . And yet now , you know , you probably think of Chicago as one of the biggest hits . What you do -- @(Cross-talking) @!CHARLIE-ROSE @(overlapping) : And -- and the movie helped make it even more famous . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Yeah , exactly . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: So what 's that difference ? What 's that fine edge that makes one thing look like a failure at one time and another time a success ? @!GAYLE-KING: It 's a hit . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: It 's -- look , put it in another way . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs for Phantom of the Opera , we might not be here talking about it . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I -- I think -- I always remember Harold Prince saying something to me which , when I was just starting out . And it was just before he agreed to direct Evita , and he said you ca n't listen to music if you ca n't look at it . I sat -- thought about that . What he actually meant was this is -- if the design of a show was n't right -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah , very inters -- very interesting . @!GAYLE-KING: You keep -- @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: -- absolutely , absolutely ruin something . @!GAYLE-KING: No , you keep saying , Andrew , Mister Webber , you keep saying that you 're -- you 're lucky . But your friends say that you 're a workaholic . Do you think that you 're a workaholic ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Well I -- @!GAYLE-KING: You clearly love what you do . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I love what I do . That 's the thing . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: One of things I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is casting on television . It 's great fun to find roles . You know , we visit -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: This is reality television ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: It is . Yes , but we -- we found some fantastic people . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah . And -- and you like the casting of it ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Well , I love working with -- with young people , I must say . And it 's great , you know , to have an opportunity to do that . @!GAYLE-KING: You write such beautiful , beautiful love songs . Are you a hopeless romantic ? You 've been -- you 've been married . You 've got five -- you 're married now . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: You 've got five children . Are you a hopeless romantic ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I am a romantic , yes . Yeah , but I care very much about -- I mean , I found , well , let me put it in another way . I find it very difficult to write about a character I do n't care about . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really had to do was -- was Evita . Because I -- I do n't find a lot -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Did n't like her ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: No , I do n't like her . @!GAYLE-KING: No. @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: But -- but I found a way of doing it . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Which I think , you know , made that one -- @!GAYLE-KING: And is n't Ricky Martin going to be in Evita ? @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Yes , he 's -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah , that 's -- @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: -- he 's going to play Che in Evita -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: And a wonderful Argentine girl called Elena Roger . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: It 's great to have you at this table . @!ANDREW-LLOYD-WEBBE: Thank you very much . @!GAYLE-KING: I hope you -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Andrew Lloyd Webber . We hear this morning that Jay-Z , the great Jay-Z and Beyonce 's baby may have -- may have a very important godmother . We hope that Gayle will set the record straight for us . You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!ERICA-HILL: A lot of buzz on the internet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blue Ivy , is none other than Oprah Winfrey . I do n't know if anybody at the table would know anything about that . Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: No. @!GAYLE-KING: Well , let me just say , if that 's true , if that 's true , it is news to her . @!ERICA-HILL: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: It is news to her . You know , she was heading to South Africa when baby Blue was born . She did n't even know the baby had been born yet . So , no , it 's absolutely not true that she 's the godmother . She 's friends with them , of course . @!ERICA-HILL: Right . @!GAYLE-KING: And likes them both very much . She 's working on sending a baby gift . She has n't even had time to send a baby gift -- @!ERICA-HILL: Because reportedly she 's already -- @!GAYLE-KING: -- because she 's been away . @!ERICA-HILL: -- she 's already sent one . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: What 's a perfect baby gift ? @!GAYLE-KING: Oh , that 's so hard , Charlie . I have -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ERICA-HILL @(overlapping) : I think the one that comes from the heart . @!GAYLE-KING: But , listen , let me -- let me talk about this for a second . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Uh-Huh . @!GAYLE-KING: When I sat down , America , Charlie said to me , what is that on your neck ? I said , it is a necklace . @!ERICA-HILL: This is good . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: I did . But it -- @!GAYLE-KING: And what did -- what did he say , Erica ? @!CHARLIE-ROSE: But -- but -- but -- @!ERICA-HILL: Charlie said -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: -- but before you say that , how many did you have on when you sat down ? @!GAYLE-KING: Oh , no , no I had -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: How many did you have on ? @!GAYLE-KING: I did have two . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yeah . And were -- @!GAYLE-KING: -- but Erica , what did he say ? @!ERICA-HILL: And it was gorgeous . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: And were they shiny or not ? Were they very shiny ? @!ERICA-HILL: Charlie said -- @!GAYLE-KING: It was very shiny . @!ERICA-HILL: -- it was n't about the shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he say , Erica ? @(Cross-talking) @!ERICA-HILL: He said it looks like Lady Gaga sausage . @!GAYLE-KING: He said it looks like you 're wearing sausages around your neck . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: I did . @!GAYLE-KING: And I said that 's not the look I 'm going for . And you said -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: You want to be Lady Gaga elegant . @!GAYLE-KING: Yes . I said I was going for elegant -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: That 's the way I think of Lady Gaga elegant . @!GAYLE-KING: She is that . I said I was going for elegant and classy and then Charlie said , well , it 's that too . Sausages and elegant . @!ERICA-HILL: @(INDISTINCT) does not look like a life preserver. @(Cross-Talking) @!GAYLE-KING: Thank you , Charlie . @!ERICA-HILL: I like it , Gayle. @!GAYLE-KING: Thank you , Charlie Rose . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: All right . That does it for us but we want you to look at some of the people who brought you this broadcast over the past weekend . Tomorrow on CBS Saturday , interesting things , watch that as well . @!GAYLE-KING: Take it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step down this week . @!REPRESENTATIVE-NAN: All of us come to the floor today to salute her . REPRESENTATIVE WASSER@!MAN-SCHULTZ: Gabby , we 'll be friends for life . @!MAN-# 1 : The President of the United States . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O: No bailouts , no handouts and no copouts . And asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes ? Most Americans would call that common sense . @(Warren-Buffet-sing @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O: Good job tonight . Good job tonight . @!DR-MAVA-WILSON: Just extremely excited that she was safe , out of there . @!MAN-# 2 : Mother Nature is the baddest thing on the planet . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: A massive solar flare . @!EMMY-ROSSUM: He hits an all-time low every single episode . @!TOM-SHERAK: The news we 've all been waiting for . @!JENNIFER-LAWRENCE: The Artist . Thomas Langmann , producer . @!NANCY-O'DELL: Michelle Williams was fantastic in My Week with Marilyn . @!GAYLE-KING: Yes , she was . @!JAY-PATERNO: His legacy is going to be in his five children and his seventeen grandchildren and certainly the hundreds of players that he 's coached over the years . @!RALPH-OLIVA: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , the soul of what it 's about . @!WALTER-CRONKITE: President Kennedy died at 1 PM Central Time . @!PRESIDENT-JOHN-F-K: Well that 's a tough day . @!MAN-# 3 ( Aide ; Kennedy Tapes , November 19 , 1963 ) : It 's a hell of a day , Mister President . @!RICK-SANTORUM: There 's no @(INDISTINCT) any time when I say Florida . That 's good . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1NBC-: The speaker was given an opportunity to be the leader of our party in 1994 , and at the end of four years he had to resign in disgrace . @!JON-STEWART-@1Come: You know , even when there 's a fire inside Mitt Romney , it 's still just a weird electrical fire . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1CN: It would be nice if he had the same standard for other people that you would like to apply to you and did n't -- did n't enter into personal attacks about personal activity . @!CONAN-O'BRIEN-@1Co: When it comes to sex scandals , he 's not as bad as Bill Clinton . @!NEWT-GINGRICH: He knew he was lying under oath . I did n't do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , you got that right , and high-fived every guy on earth . @!GOVERNOR-CHRIS-CHR: I think Newt Gingrich has embarrassed the party . @!JOHN-KING-@1CNN@2: You could come back here next January or next February with a President Gingrich. @!REPRESENTATIVE-NAN @(CNN) : That will never happen . @!GLENN-CLOSE: I wo n't be ignored , Charlie . @!SHERRI-SHEPHERD: She 's compassionate , yet she is firm . She 's not afraid to shoot a gun . @!JAMES-BROWN: This ought to be an outstanding matchup . I 'm looking forward to it . @!MAN-# 4 : Look out , look out . It 's still good . The kick is good . And the Giants are going back to the Super Bowl . 
##4103552 @!CONAN-O'BRIEN-@1Co: Taco Bell has introduced a new breakfast menu . @(Crowd-cheering) @!CONAN-O'BRIEN: Yeah , Taco Bell says it 's a good idea because breakfast is the most important bowel explosion of the day . @!GAYLE-KING: Enjoy your bacon and eggs . It 's eight o'clock , welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING . I 'm Gayle King . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: And I 'm Charlie Rose with Erica Hill . A brand new poll this morning shows Mitt Romney gaining ground in Florida 's presidential primary . @!ERICA-HILL: Romney leads Newt Gingrich by nine points among likely Republican voters . That follows a solid performance by Romney in last night 's debate . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: We discovered to our shock , governor Romney owns a shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: Do you check your own investments ? You also have investments from mutual funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . @!RICK-SANTORUM-: The bigger issue here is these two gentlemen are out distracting from the most important issues we have by playing petty personal politics . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: I do not want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and said it does n't really matter , let the Chinese dominate space . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: I 'd say you 're fired . @!REPRESENTATIVE-RON: I 'm willing to challenge any of these gentlemen up here to a twenty-five-mile bike ride any time of the day in the heat of Texas . You know there are laws against age discrimination . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: Mister Speaker , I 'm not anti-immigrant . My father was born in Mexico . My wife 's father was born in Wales . That idea that I 'm anti- immigrant is repulsive. @!RICK-SANTORUM-: Those are not the clear contrast we need if we 're going to defeat Barack Obama. @!NEWT-GIGNRICH: How about if the four of us agreed for the rest of the evening , we 'll actually talk about -- @!**25;722;TOOLONG: Mister Speaker -- @!NEWT-GIGNRICH: -- issues that relate to governing America . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Political correspondent Jan Crawford 's with us again from Miami . We also have chief White House correspondent Norah O'Donnell who is in Ann Arbor , Michigan . Good morning . @!NORAH-O'DONNELL-@1: Good morning . @!JAN-CRAWFORD-@1CBS: Good morning . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Jan , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney after having a couple of bad weeks at least ? He now seems to be more aggressive , more pointed , more precise and -- and on the move as these polls may indicate . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Yes . Sorry . I did n't mean to interrupt you . I 'm like -- I 've just to say , we have seen such a different Mitt Romney this week in the debates and on the stop on the campaign trail . And I think there are two reasons for that . Number one , he got whooped in South Carolina and he knows he 's got to perform . This state is critical . If Newt Gingrich wins here , it is a whole new ballgame . So he 's really got to get down to business and win this thing . And number two , Charlie , he has a new debate coach . This guy came in over the weekend . He 's considered one of the best in the business , Brett O'Donnell . He 's been working with Governor Romney and you see a crisper , sharper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down when Gingrich tries to land a punch . It 's made a big difference . And now he 's communicated his message . @!GAYLE-KING: Yep . Jan , we can no longer say the debates do n't matter . People are saying nineteen and counting . How many more of that they have certainly made a difference . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Oh , that is absolutely right , Gayle . And especially for Newt Gingrich , think back to South Carolina . Romney had won New Hampshire . Gingrich has come in at the bottom there . You had two debates there where he took on the moderators , where he blasted the medias being biased , where he went off Barack Obama and people loved it . It saw -- we saw Gingrich skyrocket to the top and crush Romney in South Carolina . His campaign has really been fueled by these debates . But this week , it 's been a different Newt Gingrich , a different Mitt Romney . These debates have not giving Gingrich his opportunity to really take on Romney and show the voters that he alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That just has n't come through yet this week . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Erica. @!ERICA-HILL: Jan -- Jan , though , it actually looked like a different Newt Gingrich last night . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Mm-Hm. @!ERICA-HILL: He looked tired , he missed some opportunities . There 's been a lot of talk about people like Bob Dole , Tom DeLay coming out saying he 's not the guy . Could he actually be listening to some of that ? Could that be affecting him ? @!JAN-CRAWFORD: You know , that 's a great question . And I would say probably not . I mean , Newt Gingrich is a warrior . And so when he sees these guys coming out against him that 's going to make him more determined to stay in this thing and win this thing . And out on the campaign trail , talking to voters , he is feisty in your face . He 's not backing it down at all . So when you got in these debates where you really almost did seem to pull his punches a little , it 's -- it 's kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of it was Mitt Romney was not backing down . So you know , you had this back and forth and Gingrich lands a punch . And it does n't knock Romney down . He pops right back up . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Norah . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: So that was a big difference . But we also saw Gingrich trying to get back in these things and try to go after Wolf Blitzer last night , and Blitzer would n't allow it . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Norah , it is said that in Chicago where they are running the Obama campaign , that they 're so giddy that they want to run naked in Millennium Park . @!GAYLE-KING: That 's a visual . @!NORAH-O'DONNELL: Yeah . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: I think Barack just signed @(INDISTINCT) @!NORAH-O'DONNELL: They do n't -- they do n't want to interfere -- yeah , they do n't want to interfere with these debates . They think the more the American people watch these debates they get a better understanding of their opponents , the Republicans . This President is trying to stay above the fray at this point . We 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an official tour where he 's talking about certainly education today ; yesterday , energy ; the day before , manufacturing . All part of those things he talked about in the State of the Union address . But certainly politics is incredibly important . The states that we 've been to on this trip are all important swing states . And I think it should be noted we were in Arizona and Nevada yesterday . Those are part of the President 's western @(INDISTINCT) tour to victory , and that 's why the issue of immigration came up . @!GAYLE-KING: Norah , I heard the President say yesterday that he does n't watch the debates but somebody in the White House is clearly watching . Do you think they 're pulling for one candidate over the other or do you think it does n't matter to them ? @!NORAH-O'DONNELL: Well , they say publicly that they all have pretty much the same record and that they 'll run against the extreme record of these Republicans . But I think that they 're betting that Mitt Romney becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Yesterday , the Democrats pounced when they learned that Republican Mitt Romney had to amend his financial forms to include almost two dozen new things about overseas investments , including Swiss Bank accounts . So they think that 's one issue where they can continue to hit Mitt Romney as out of touch , or some one who 's not like regular Americans who has money in overseas accounts . You heard Mitt Romney say look , these are trivial sort of amendments . But the Democrats said this just shows Mitt Romney has to come clean and release more than just two years of his tax returns . @!ERICA-HILL: Norah O'Donnell , Jan Crawford , thank you both . It is eight-oh- six , now let 's get to a check of your local weather . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @!GAYLE-KING: Michael Jackson has been gone for three years now . But last night , Jackson 's children put his hand and footprints in cement at the famous Hollywood shrine . We 're going to take you there . You are watching CBS THIS MORNING . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!GAYLE-KING: Got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and footprints at Hollywood 's famous Chinese theater . So more than two years after his death , his children did it for him . @!ERICA-HILL: And some very famous fans were there to see it as well . National correspondent Ben Tracy is in Hollywood this morning . Ben , good morning . @!BEN-TRACY-@1CBS-Ne: Good morning from Hollywood . You know , here at the famous Grauman 's Chinese Theater , they have handprints and footprints from all sorts of famous people , from Jimmy Stewart to the cast of Harry Potter . And this will be the latest , Michael Jackson , the imprint of his famous sequined glove over there , his footprints . And then the handprints of his three children who , just hours ago , took steps to ensure their father 's Hollywood immortality . @(Begin-VT) @!PRINCE-MICHAEL-JAC: I think I speak for him as well . This right here is his lifetime achievement award . @(Michael-Jackson-si @!BEN-TRACY: In his lifetime , Michael Jackson had been celebrated with Gold Records and Grammys , but this was a recognition like none other . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Theater after his death . Michael Jackson 's children Prince , Paris and Blanket took their father 's shoes and that famous sequined glove protected from the cement with a thin piece of plastic and left an impression that will never be erased. @!QUINCY-JONES: It 's the only fitting that Michael be enshrined here today in front of Grauman 's Chinese Theater , alongside the great song-and-dance men that he so admired . @!BEN-TRACY: Jackson 's longtime producer Quincy Jones joined thousands of Jackson fans to pay one more tribute to the King of Pop . @!WOMAN-# 1 : Even though he passed away , he still lives . @!WOMAN-# 2 : I think he really deserves this and so much more . @!KATHERINE-JACKSON-: It 's a very good celebration . And I know if Michael was here , he would agree . @!JUSTIN-BIEBER: Michael meant so much to me. @!BEN-TRACY: Singer Justin Bieber said he drew inspiration from one particular song from Michael 's Jackson Five days . @(Justin-Bieber-sing @!BEN-TRACY: So you may be wondering why this event is happening now or it 's being produced by Michael Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity stunt . Michael Jackson 's concert with Cirque de Soleil hits Los Angeles this weekend . And fans got a preview of that Cirque show after the ceremony . @(Michael-Jackson-si @!BEN-TRACY: Jackson 's children were immortalized as well , leaving their hand prints alongside those of their famous father . @(End-VT) @!BEN-TRACY: And now this thing weighs about a thousand pounds . So it needs to set for a good ten days before it can go out into the courtyard . The folks here tell us it will be on public display about the middle of next month . Until then , it will have twenty-four-hour security . So Erica , Gayle , do n't get any ideas . @!GAYLE-KING: Darn , I was just getting ready to get on a plane and come to L.A. Ben , you just mentioned that it 's very heavy , a thousand pounds . Does it mean that it 's going to stay there forever ? @!BEN-TRACY: Oh , well , as we all know , nothing really lasts in this town forever . But being in cement here is about as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920s . And those very first footprints and handprints from 1927 are actually still here in the ground . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm . Good to know . Thank you , Ben Tracy reporting from Los Angeles . I ca n't get over , Erica , the Jackson kids , Paris -- @!ERICA-HILL: I know . @!GAYLE-KING: -- in particular . She 's so gorgeous , so pretty -- @!ERICA-HILL: Miracle . @!GAYLE-KING: -- and they 've grown so much in two and a half years . @!ERICA-HILL: So grown up . @!GAYLE-KING: I like them . @!ERICA-HILL: It 's wild . Wild . @!GAYLE-KING: And they seem okay . @!ERICA-HILL: They seem like they 're doing really well -- @!GAYLE-KING: Seem okay . @!ERICA-HILL: -- which is very nice to see . Working for a winemaker , turns out , is not just a bowl of grapes . That 's what the CEO found out when he became an undercover boss . This is one of our favorite series here on here on CBS . You 'll meet him and show you -- we 'll show you what he found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong when you start a day with Bruce Springsteen . Recently the president of Kendall Jackson Wine Estates in California got down in the trenches to see what life is really like for his employees . He 's the latest undercover boss . @(Begin-VT) @!MARCOS: One case right there . @!RICK-TIGNER-@1Pres: Okay . @!MARCOS: Go ahead . Hold up , you got to push it first . @!RICK-TIGNER: Yeah . I got it .

Good morning , great to have you here . @!RICK-TIGNER: It 's great to be here . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: So what did you learn ? @!RICK-TIGNER: You -- you know , I learned a lot . Going undercover gave me a great opportunity to really see the passion and commitment , you know , that we had with our employees . You know , I have this one concept I call look , listen and learn . @!GAYLE-KING: Yep . @!RICK-TIGNER: And it really is , you know , a lot of bosses they want to go to meetings and they want to talk a lot . And I think you get more from your employees if you actually give them a voice and you actually listen to what they have to say . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: So going undercover for me it gave me a great opportunity not just to , you know , see the passion and commitment , but actually just to hear their stories . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: And did you learn things you did n't know about your company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I 've actually been with the company for -- for twenty years . But I ran sales and distribution for the first eighteen . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: And really , when I first became the president , you know , Jess Jackson who founded the company , he really mentored me -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: -- you know , for the first six months . So I had n't had a chance really to get out into the production , wineries or being in the field . But I learned a lot about our employees . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Right . @!RICK-TIGNER: You know , their passionate , their committed , their intelligent . They want to learn . You just got to stay and engaged . @!GAYLE-KING: You know what I learned about you , Rick , you 're not very good on bottle line . @!RICK-TIGNER: No arguing that . @!GAYLE-KING: That 's what I learned about you . You need some bottle line lessons my friend . So what was it like ? Because normally the boss does n't take direction from the employees , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ? Was that a enriching experience for you ? What was that ? @!RICK-TIGNER: You know , I -- I took it all in . It was a humbling experience because I -- honestly , on the bottling line , I was trying . I mean , I think I 'm a pretty -- @!GAYLE-KING: That was you trying ? @!RICK-TIGNER: That was me trying . I actually got pretty coordinated . @!GAYLE-KING: Yes . @!RICK-TIGNER: But , you know , Marcos is an expert . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: And the people that work on the bottling line are experts at what they do . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mm. @!RICK-TIGNER: So I was just -- again , trying to look , listen and learn . And so I was trying to pick it up as fast as I could . But the reality was I definitely had an I-Love-Lucy moment -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yes . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mm. @!RICK-TIGNER: -- as you see . @!GAYLE-KING: For sure . @!RICK-TIGNER: And -- but Marcos turned out to be a great supervisor , a great trainer . And today I would argue he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that . But the thing that I liked , I became so smitten with you because you showed so much -- so much emotion . You got choked up talking about your lovely wife , Wendy . @!RICK-TIGNER: Right . @!GAYLE-KING: You got moved by an employee 's story . You got moved when you 're talking about your mentor , Jess Jackson , where you really showed a lot of emotion . It was n't a boo-hoo crying , but we can tell . @!RICK-TIGNER: Right . @!GAYLE-KING: I -- I thought of you as such a tender man . Do you regret showing that much emotion , because men most of the time do n't do that . @!RICK-TIGNER: Yeah . @!GAYLE-KING: I loved it . @!RICK-TIGNER: Well , first of all , you have -- you have to be who you are . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah , I love it . @!RICK-TIGNER: It is what it is . And , you know , I love my wife and I love Jess Jackson . You know , and -- and the show happened right after Jess passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the family , you know , because we 're a family-owned company . And I 've always been a part of that what I would call extended family . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mm. @!RICK-TIGNER: And so my connection with Jess right after he passed , there was a lot of emotion . And obviously , my wife and being away for seven days and doing the show seven days in a row , you know , I actually missed her . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: So what -- @!GAYLE-KING: But I love that you showed it . @!RICK-TIGNER: Yeah . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: -- so what 's your action plan now that you 've had this experience ? Do you want to do it with other people within the company ? They go do it and find out what it 's like ? @!RICK-TIGNER: Exactly . You know , always about -- a lot of CEOs or bosses they want to fly at thirty thousand feet . You know , my whole goal and what Jess- - @!GAYLE-KING: Sure . @!RICK-TIGNER: -- taught me was , you -- you got to fly at three feet . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , and that 's what 's valuable about the show . It 's not the show , which is great , it 's what you do afterwards . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Right . @!RICK-TIGNER: So things that we 've already done . You know , language classes , you know , now we have over two hundred employees taking language classes . @!GAYLE-KING: Well , that 's crucial , because you had a twenty-four-year-old supervisor who could n't communicate with the Spanish-speaking workers . @!RICK-TIGNER: Right . @!GAYLE-KING: And they could n't communicate with her . @!RICK-TIGNER: Right . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: I knew we had Hispanic workers , who could n't speak English , but what I really did n't know was that our leadership team -- @!GAYLE-KING: Ca n't speak Spanish . @!RICK-TIGNER: -- could n't communicate with them . And if you truly are going to be a great company , you have to have great communication . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Right . @!RICK-TIGNER: So it 's what we 've done afterwards to improve that communication which makes it a great place to work . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and companies . @!RICK-TIGNER: It truly is. @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: You 've got to communicate . @!RICK-TIGNER: Well , you know , it takes all kinds people to make a world and it takes -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!RICK-TIGNER: -- all kinds of people to make up a great company . @!GAYLE-KING: No , you are really nice guy . Really nice guy . Rick -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: I 've -- I 've never seen us so taken with a guest . @!GAYLE-KING: No , I know . I 'm trying not to gush . But he 's -- he was something . He was something else . Thank you , Rick . @!RICK-TIGNER: Thank you . @!GAYLE-KING: You can see Undercover Boss and Rick in action this Sunday night at ten o ' clock , seven Central right here , on CBS . You are watching CBS THIS MORNING . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) 
##4103553 @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1Th: By the end of my second term , we will have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be American . @!JON-STEWART-@1The-: A mo -- a moon base ? Your solution to being accused of grandiosity is give me eight years and I 'll have a ( EXPLETIVE DELETED ) moon base . What did you -- did you start with Death Star and you got kind of reined in ? @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING . @!ERICA-HILL: Former hostage Jessica Buchanan is recovering at a U.S. Navy base in Sicily this morning . Her family is meeting her there . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Buchanan is also having medical screenings and other evaluations before she returns home . Allen Pizzey is outside the U.S. base in Sigonella . Allen , good morning . @!ALLEN-PIZZEY-@1CBS: Good morning , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: What do we know about her health that caused the United States to go in when it did because Tom Donilon , the national security advisor , told me last night on the program that , in fact , it was her health that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we understand , Charlie , that she may have had something of a kidney problem . They 're not giving any details about her health other than to say that she may have had a -- a medical problem . But also the timing was geared to what the Navy SEALs wanted . It was a -- a clear night with a new moon . That 's good for them for night vision fighting , bad for the enemy because they ca n't see very well . So it was a combination of factors . But her health was certainly one of them . And we think it was a kidney problem , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Are they worried , the United States forces and people there , that there might be some kind of retaliation because of this raid ? @!ALLEN-PIZZEY: Well , there is a lot of debate over that , Charlie . The armed rescue of hostages does put the -- put the wind up , if you will , the -- the kidnappers . And there is another American held -- a journalist is being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pirates that they moved him three times immediately following the raid that rescued Jessica Buchanan and -- and Poul Thisted . But the military , of course , says look if they are there we can get them and we will . But there are nearly a hundred and sixty foreigners being held by pirates at the moment . And is it -- is a concern that there could be violent retaliation against them if there is another raid to rescue hostages , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Allen , thank you very much . Senior correspondent John Miller is with us now along with 60 MINUTES correspondent Bob Simon . You may recall that Bob was captured in Iraq while covering the Persian-Gulf war in 1991 . He was held prisoner for forty days . Good morning . @!BOB-SIMON-@160-MIN: Morning , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: So give us the sense of -- of what it means and -- and what you 're going through and how did you recover after coming back from that kind of horri -- horrific experience . You , of course , wrote a book about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're just ecstatic . I mean you 're free . You did n't think you were going to survive . So it 's pure ecstasy . And that lasts forty-eight , seventy-two hours . And then , reality sinks in on and you do n't really feel so good anymore . You 're more fragile than you think you are at first . And it 's good to -- it 's good to go far away , go skiing or go to mountain climbing in Nepal or take a sled to the North Pole . Just get away from it all . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Just get your mind away from everything that you 've been through ? @!BOB-SIMON: Yeah . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: What do you need in terms of support ? I mean , what -- is there something that you need beyond that sort of the -- clearing of your mind ? @!BOB-SIMON: Well , first of all , clearing of your mind does n't really work . It 's just -- it 's just fun to do that . You do n't really ever clear your mind . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be with somebody you really like or love . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Yeah , exactly . @!BOB-SIMON: After that , it 's also good to be on your own for a while . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Do even now , do you think about this ? Is that always there ? @!BOB-SIMON: Not much . It 's always there , but I do n't think about it much . @!ERICA-HILL: What about the -- the process ? And we 'll touch more what exactly the process in a second with John . But -- but the process that you went through in terms of a reintegration that Jessica Buchanan is going through now , how much did that help you ? @!BOB-SIMON: Oh , I did n't have a process . I did everything wrong . Nobody told me very much . And all of a sudden when you get out of a situation like this , you 're very famous . You -- you have your twenty-four hours . So I was in bed in a hospital where they were checking me out . And you know , for forty days , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting all these friendly , warm , humane , sympathetic calls from lecture agents and publishers and mag -- and you know , they 're all concerned about -- @!ERICA-HILL: Very concerned . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: They were worried about your wealth there , were n't they ? @!BOB-SIMON: Indeed they were . And I was working the phones , which was exactly the wrong thing to do . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: And all those television producers who wanted you to tell -- @!ERICA-HILL: Yes . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: -- your story only with them . @!BOB-SIMON: There was that . @!ERICA-HILL: Luckily you already worked for one network . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mister Miller , what do you -- what do you think about this -- this whole process because you have been involved in sort of anti-terrorism efforts ? @!JOHN-MILLER-@1CBS-: Well , I -- I think Bob touched on it which is there actually has to be a process . And people who are in captivity for a time and then get thrown back into normal life really they pay the price for not having had that organized for them . A lot of this was developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to civilian hostages . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mm. @!ERICA-HILL: So what would be happening right now today for -- for Jessica and for -- and for the Poul , the Danish man ? @!JOHN-MILLER: Well , the -- the military has developed this doctrine , the FBI and the intelligence agencies all use it now . It 's the Personnel Recovery Agency Doctrine . But it 's a three-phase , to speak generally , three-phase process that they go through . Phase one is the initial checkout , you know , what is your current physical condition , psychological condition . Phase two is really a decompression where they let you tell your story , they let you have some contact with family . And they do an assessment of how you 're doing . Phase three is your action plan , your action plan to get back to your normal life . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Did you have an action plan , Bob ? @!BOB-SIMON: Yeah , I went back to work immediately which was a very dumb thing to do . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Why was it a dumb thing to do ? @!BOB-SIMON: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , you 're -- you 're still -- your -- your head is in a million places -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Yeah . @!BOB-SIMON: -- and none of them are good . And you should n't get back to -- to real life right away . Because you -- you have no idea what 's been going on with you . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: And you 're probably the only person who knows internally because it will be different for every person . @!BOB-SIMON: Exactly . Sure . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Thank you . Thank you , John . Thank you , Bob . @!JOHN-MILLER: Glad to be here . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Do n't forget you can see 60 MINUTES this Sunday night , right here on CBS . @!ERICA-HILL: Plenty of attention paid to Alec Baldwin when he got in trouble on that flight recently . Turns out , though , he 's not the only one who does n't want to turn off his phone on a plane . So do you really need to ? Is it dangerous ? We 'll answer the question once and for all , when we return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go into the sky there at New York 's LaGuardia Airport . Most of us have been on a plane , where there is someone using a cell phone , even after the crew tells you to shut them off . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Sometimes they get kicked off the flight like Alec Baldwin , but is it really dangerous to leave them on during take off and landing ? John Blackstone has the answer to one of the great mysteries of travel . @(Begin-VT) @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: We hear it every time we fly . @!WOMAN-# 1 : Your mobile phones and other electronic devices should be turned off . @!DREW-KEETH-@1Airli: It 's kind of frustrating , because I 'm usually like in the middle of an e-mail , or game of solitaire , or something . @!WOMAN-# 2 : Electronic devices need to be turned off when the electronic device line is on . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: When Alec Baldwin got thrown off a flight last month for refusing to turn off his phone , he became an icon for all those who think the rule is outdated . @!ALEC-BALDWIN-@1Act: These rules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told CNN 's Piers Morgan , flyers need to switch off anyway . @!ALEC-BALDWIN: It 's still something you have to contend with . Just turn your phone off while you 're in flight . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: Clearly , the person who shot this YouTube video did not turn off during landing . And just as clearly , there was no disaster . @!CAPTAIN-CHESLEY-SU: There are people who think , huh , it 's no big deal . And -- and I think for the most part , it isn't. @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: But Captain Sully Sullenberger knows better than most that every once in a while something quite unexpected can happen on an airplane. @!CAPTAIN-CHESLEY-SU: The bottom line for me is very simple . None of us has the right to put others at risk for our own convenience . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: The fact that nothing bad has happened , I think has convinced a lot of people , this rule is n't necessary anymore . @!CAPTAIN-CHESLEY-SU: It seems like the -- the documented problems are fairly rare . But there are some . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: An Airbus A320 was on approach for landing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( air traffic control ) frequencies.were totally blocked.by a passenger cell phone searching for service . " When the phone was turned off , the problem stopped . A half dozen similar incidents have been listed on NASA 's Aviation Safety Reporting Systems since 2004. @!CAPTAIN-CHESLEY-SU: From the ones that concern me , and they 're rare , are where there are navigational radios that are affected when you 're trying to land in low visibility close to the ground . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: For all those who hate switching off their devices , here is the guy to blame , Dave Carson , an engineer at Boeing and co-chairman of the FAA Committee that made the rule . @!DAVE-CARSON-@1Boei: It 's easier just to say turn them all off . They have a -- if they have a battery , turn it off . If they have a switch , turn it off . @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: The ban on cell phone use has as much to do with the cell phone network as it does with air safety . On the ground , a phone signal usually reaches just one or two cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket hundreds of towers , potentially disrupting the entire system . In the huge factory where Boeing builds 747s , Carson says , the potential for interference can depend on how close a passenger is sitting to an aircraft antenna . @!DAVE-CARSON: Some of the antennas you can see on top of the airplane , those are the antennas that we 're talking about , potential interference . So a passenger sitting right there by that window , the signal can get right out into the antenna . @!CAPTAIN-CHESLEY-SU: Each time we fly and people leave devices on , they 're conducting an unauthorized scientific experiment to see if this time it makes any difference , if it affects anything electronically on the airplane. @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE: So next time you fly , if you leave something turned on , the plane probably wo n't crash . But then again , you do n't want to be on the first one that does . For CBS THIS MORNING , John Blackstone , Seattle . @(End-VT) @!ERICA-HILL: Questions answered ? @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: I 'm prepared to listen to Sully . @!ERICA-HILL: Okay . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour now . Let 's get you a check of your local weather . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Some good news brewing for tea lovers .

The Mascot for the NHL 's Tampa Bay Lightning has now been fired after this YouTube video showed her spraying an opposing team 's fan . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Last night , King of Pop Michael Jackson was honored in the way that only Hollywood can , his sequined glove and shoes were imprinted in cement at Grauman 's Chinese Theater . Jackson 's three children did the honors . There were plenty of big names on hand -- Justin Bieber was there along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big celebration . @!ERICA-HILL: It is time now for this morning 's HealthWatch . Here 's Doctor Holly Phillips . @!DR-HOLLY-PHILLIPS-: Good morning . In today 's HealthWatch , black tea and heart health . Researchers say there 's new evidence that black tea may lower your blood pressure . A recent study found people who drank three cups a day lowered their pressure by an average of two to three points . Now , that may not sound like much , but even small reductions can have a major impact . Researchers say their results would translate into a ten percent reduction in the prevalence of hypertension and a seven to ten percent reduction in heart attack and stroke . High blood pressure is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. And it 's a factor in more than three hundred thousand deaths a year . Nearly one in three American adults has high blood pressure and a quarter have pre- hypertension , putting them at risk .

Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich go at each other again in the latest Florida debate . Our own Bob Schieffer will break down the field .

My wife 's father was born in Wales . The idea that I 'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich battle over immigration and personal finance in the fight for Florida . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1R-: Maybe Governor Romney you should tell us how much money he 's made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1CNN@: I know that sounds like an enormous revelation , but have you checked your own investments ? @!JIMMY-KIMMEL-@1Jim: Why are they doing something -- what is left to know about these candidates ? Is one of them going to confess to a murder ? @!REPRESENTATIVE-RON: I do n't think we should go to the moon . I think we maybe should send some politicians up there at times . @!JON-STEWART-@1The-: And that 's why I 'm going to make Ron Paul my first ambassador to Moonlandia. @!ALEX-GREGORY: I would expect him to be the next Albert Einstein , not a -- a bomber . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Utah 's student in custody after an alleged plot to bomb their own school . @!MAN-# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . @!SCOTT-PELLEY: If President Obama wins reelection , he may very well have to find a new secretary of state . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-@1: After twenty years , it would be a -- probably , a good idea to just find out how tired I am. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Twitter can now censor messages on a country-by-country basis . @!MAN-# 2 : Michael Jackson 's three kids helped immortalize their father in Hollywood . @!MAN-# 3 : Well , a pony was on the loose and on the run in the residential neighborhood today . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: All that -- @!MAN-# 4 @(ESPN) : @(INDISTINCT) @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: -- and all of that matters -- @(Excerpt-from-Ferri @!MAN-# 5 @(NCAA/ESPN) : Oh , the big shot . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: -- on CBS THIS MORNING . @!DAN-LE-BATARD-@1ES: Have you ever done Wheel of Fortune a little bit drunk ? @!PAT-SAJAK-@1ESPN@2: Vanna and I would go across and have two or three or six . @!DAN-LE-BATARD: Was the show better or worse ? @!MAN-# 6 ( King World Entertainment ) : Like heaven on earth . @!MAN-# 7 ( King World Entertainment ) : Yeah , that 's it . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final Republican debate before the all-important Florida primary . And last night 's event may have been the most substantive of all them . @!ERICA-HILL: Definitely heard a lot from the candidates . Political correspondent Jan Crawford is in Miami to break it all down for us . Jan , good morning . @!JAN-CRAWFORD-@1CBS: Well , good morning , guys . You know , everyone thought this was going to be some death match between Romney and Gingrich and there were a lot of punches thrown . But the interesting thing about the debate last night was how every one of those candidates on the stage brought their A-game. @(Begin-VT) @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Moments after they took the stage , the expected fireworks between Romney and Gingrich went off . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: So maybe Governor Romney in the spirit of openness should tell us how much money he 's made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments . But let 's be clear about that . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1R-Pr: Mister Speaker , I know that sounds like an enormous revelation , but have you checked your own investments ? @!JAN-CRAWFORD: The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac whose loans helped trigger the housing crisis . Gingrich has done work for the company but he said Romney at one point had investments in it . Romney said the former speaker did too . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: You also have investments through mutual funds that also invest at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Texas Congressman Ron Paul spoke for many when he said -- @!REPRESENTATIVE-RON: That subject really does n't interest me a whole lot . @(Crowd-cheering) @!REPRESENTATIVE-RON: The question is , what are we going to do about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ? It should have been auctioned off right after the crash came . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: And former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum hammered the point home . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1R-: Can we set aside that Newt was a member of Congress and used the skills that he developed as a member of Congress to go out and advise companies , and that 's not the worst thing in the world ; and that Mitt Romney is a wealthy guy because he worked hard and he is going out and working hard . And you should -- guys should leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On many of the issues there are n't a lot of differences except on this question , and yes this came up exploring the moon . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: But I 'll tell you , I do not want to be the country that having gotten to the moon first , turned around and said it does n't really matter , let the Chinese dominate space , what do we care ? @!MITT-ROMNEY-: I spent twenty-five years in business . If -- if I had a business executive come to me and say they want to spend a few hundred billion dollars to put a colony on the moon , I 'd say you 're fired . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Romney owned that phrase last night and he also was blunt about his wealth . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: I 'm proud of being successful . I 'm proud of being in the free enterprise system that creates jobs for other people . I 'm not going to run from that . @(End-VT) @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Now this was the nineteenth debate and it was really one of the best . Maybe you got to have nineteen of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys on that stage today , good job explaining their positions on the issues . And that is not good news for Newt Gingrich . He needed a standout performance to suggest he alone could take on Barack Obama . And he did n't have that . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: So what does he do now , Jan ? What does the Gingrich campaign do between now and election to regain some of that surge momentum they thought they had coming out of Florida . @!JAN-CRAWFORD: He needed -- he would really have to kind of get out on the stump all weekend long , which is what he 's been doing here this week , meeting with different communities and encouraging them to come out and turn out that vote . He needed that momentum from last night to carry him through the weekend . Now he 'll be here later today here in Miami . Then they 'll have a lot of events over the weekend ending up in the Panhandle , more conservative part of the state at the beginning of the week . But again , last night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more work to do to kind of continue to rally the troops he get it going -- going into Tuesday 's vote . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Thank you very much , Jan Crawford. @!ERICA-HILL: This morning , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says she is ready to leave politics . Despite those rumors , she might replace Joe Biden as President Obama 's running mate . Whit Johnson is in Washington where Clinton talked openly about her future on Thursday . Whit , good morning , a little more detail than we 've heard in the past . @!WHIT-JOHNSON-@1CBS: Absolutely , Erica , good morning to you . Yes , Secretary Clinton made the remarks at a State Department Town Hall . This is n't the first time she 's talked about stepping away from politics . But with every question she answers about her future , more questions seem to follow . @(Begin-VT) @!WHIT-JOHNSON: Two decades as one of the most recognizable faces of the Democratic Party may have finally caught up to the secretary of state . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-@1: It would be a -- probably , a good idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims that political fatigue has kept her from watching any Republican debates . Still , she says she 's committed to her current position . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-: I have made it clear that , you know , I will certainly stay on until the President nominates someone and that transition can occur . @!WHIT-JOHNSON: But speculation that perhaps , Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden will swap jobs continues to swirl albeit with minimal sourcing . Though , it 's not impossible , says Bill Clinton 's former labor secretary Robert Reich . @!ROBERT-REICH-@1For: It would be good for the President , good for the party ; more importantly , good for the country . @!WHIT-JOHNSON: Clinton and Biden both have rejected the idea . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-: I have absolutely no interest and no reason for doing anything other than just dismissing these stories and moving on . @!JOE-BIDEN: Hillary likes her job where she is . I like my job where I am. @!WHIT-JOHNSON: And Clinton 's close friends call it highly unlikely . @!LANNY-DAVIS-@1Clin: I know her for forty years . That 's what I know . And I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that she 's had a great time as secretary of state . And I know that she wants to be with Chelsea and President Clinton and relax a while . @!WHIT-JOHNSON: But always the clever politician , the secretary gave us just enough to keep on guessing . @!HILLARY-CLINTON-: Everyone always says that when they leave these jobs . @(End-VT) @!WHIT-JOHNSON: A recent Bloomberg poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans have a favorable view of Mrs. Clinton . Still , she has said in numerous interviews that she will not serve a second term as secretary of state , and she will not run for President in 2016. @!ERICA-HILL: Whit Johnson , thank you . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: We now go to Miami , and bring in chief Washington correspondent and host of FACE THE NATION , Bob Schieffer . Bob , good morning . @!BOB-SCHIEFFER-@1CB: Hey , good morning . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Let me turn to Hillary Clinton before I talk about Florida . Do you think there 's any circumstances in which the President of the United States might decide that he 'd rather have Hillary Clinton as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the -- if he decided that was the only way he could possibly win . I do n't think many people thought that Jack Kennedy would put Lyndon Johnson on the ticket . But he came to the conclusion it 's this way or no way . And so he did . I do n't think that 's going to happen . I- - I think that 's remote . But every -- every presidential candidate is going to do exactly what he thinks he has to do to win . And I guess if it came down to that , he would do it . But I do n't think that 's very likely . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: We saw a little bit of that last night in the debate . People are saying that this was a more aggressive Mitt Romney and that 's what they want to see on the part of Romney to stop this surge for Newt Gingrich ? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER: Well , I think that 's exactly right . What has happened here , Charlie , is Newt Gingrich has made a much better debater out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing . He does n't like to get in there and mix it up . He 's now got him a new debate coach . Gingrich has kept just slamming it to him . And -- and tonight he came up with -- or last night I should say , he came up with some answers . He -- I think this was probably the best he has done from the standpoint of a debate . But Gingrich , I do n't necessarily agree with Jan , where she says that all four candidates is now -- it 's not a four-man race . This is still between Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney . And Gingrich has been drawing very -- very big crowds . All the polling shows that this is very , very close . And I do n't think anybody thinks that Ron Paul is going to somehow be a -- a major factor down here . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: But did Newt Gingrich -- @!BOB-SCHIEFFER: He provides relieve during these debates , but he -- he will get a , you know , his usual percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates , I do n't think . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: But some are saying this was a last chance in a debate for Gingrich to really to make a difference . Did he lose an opportunity that he has to regain ? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER: Well , there -- look -- there were no knockouts in this . This was -- this was a debate where neither -- neither of the candidates knocked the other one out . I think there were some good moments for both of them . I -- I would kind of call this a draw . I have n't been here long enough to really get a sense of how the voters are taking all this . I have a pretty good sense of the candidates . I thought Gingrich and Romney mixed it up pretty good . I thought Romney was the best that he has been , thus far . But I do n't think this is over yet . @!ERICA-HILL: Bob , I do want to ask you quickly about Rick Santorum , because he did have a good performance last night . He 's been pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he called to basically focus on the issues and forget the needling that 's been going on . Is it too little too late , though , for him ? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER: Probably , I think he has run a good campaign , I thought he was quite good . I thought he -- he did a good job last night . But I -- I do not see Rick Santorum finishing between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich however this comes out . I think it 's going to be Gingrich and Romney or Romney and Gingrich , right now at this point . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Bob , thanks so much . @!BOB-SCHIEFFER: Yeah . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: This Sunday , Bob will have more from Florida as FACE THE NATION debuts it 's new -- its new hour-long format , longtime coming and we 're glad it 's here , focusing on Tuesday 's primary . Thousands gathered at Penn State University on Thursday to say a final goodbye to Joe Paterno. @!ERICA-HILL: As Terrell Brown reports , the memorial service was a tribute to beloved coach . It was also a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devoted family man and hero wronged . That 's how former Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was remembered yesterday at a public memorial on the university 's campus . His son , Jay , addressed the crowd of twelve thousands students , alumni and fans who packed the schools basketball arena . @!JAY-PATERNO-@1Joe-: He wanted to use his remaining time on earth to see Penn State continue to thrive . He never spoke ill and never wanted anyone to feel badly for him . @!TERRELL-BROWN: Paterno 's death at eighty-five came less than three months after his stunning dismissal as head coach . The child sex abuse charges against his retired assistant , Jerry Sandusky , ended his career and may have tarnished his decades-long legacy . So yesterday 's memorial was not only a chance to remember Paterno , but to burnish his memory . Nike Chairman Phil Knight brought the crowd to its feet for nearly a minute when he called Paterno his hero , and said the coach was treated unfairly . @!PHIL-KNIGHT-@1Nike: Whatever the details of the investigation are , this much is clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lies in that investigation , not in Joe Paterno 's response to it . @(Applause) @!TERRELL-BROWN: Former players spoke about the impact Paterno had on their lives . Current pro-ball player Michael Robinson talked about the promises Paterno made , not money or a car as other schools did . @!MICHAEL-ROBINSON-@: He promised that my education would be second to none . He promised me that I 'd play in front of the best fans in college football . @!TERRELL-BROWN: And yesterday , those fans said a final goodbye . @!JAY-PATERNO: Dad , you won . You did all you could do . You 've done enough . We all love you . You won . You can go home now . @!TERRELL-BROWN: For CBS THIS MORNING , Terrell Brown . @(End-VT) @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: In Utah , two teenagers accused of a plot to set off a bomb at their high school . @!ERICA-HILL: Police say one of them was so fascinated with the Columbine disaster , he actually went through to meet with the school 's principal . Matt Egan of our Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports from Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HOLLY-CANRIGHT-@1N: I had no idea that he would -- he was even thinking of this . And I do n't think his parents knew , either . @!MATT-EGAN: Classmates scared about what could have happened . @!ALEX-GREGORY: I would expect him to be the next Albert Einstein , not you know a -- a bomber . @!TAYLOR-BELL: I was like shocked . It was , like , I ca n't believe that was him . @!MATT-EGAN: Taylor Bell being lived down the street from the sixteen-year- old suspect . @!TAYLOR-BELL: I was pretty close to him for a long time . @!MATT-EGAN: But once they entered high school , things changed . His friend became withdrawn . Neighbors noticed it too . @!HOLLY-CANRIGHT: He just did n't have many friends around . @!MATT-EGAN: Still they did n't suspect anything , especially not a high school bomb plot . @!HOLLY-CANRIGHT: He was always polite . @!MATT-EGAN: An only child . Neighbors say they never saw any red flags or experiments with explosives . @!HOLLY-CANRIGHT: If he and this kid ever tried to blow anything up , they did not do it here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where it came from . @!MATT-EGAN: As for flying to Denver to visit Columbine , police say he flew on his own , skipping school without permission , all with the intent to learn more about the school-shooting massacre . When interviewed by police , he said those killers only completed one percent of their plan and I am much more intelligent than that . @!GIRL: He was smart . He was really smart . @!MATT-EGAN: As for the other suspect , neighbors and friends say eighteen- year-old Dallin Morgan was a good student taking AP classes . @!GIRL: Just a shocker , and that you would never expected him to do that . @!MATT-EGAN: In the end , Roy High School was just glad that concerned students came forward before the plan could be carried out . @!NATE-TAGGART-@1Web: We commend the student that came forward . We hope in similar situations the students will have the courage to do the same thing . @(End-VT) @!ERICA-HILL: A follow-up for you this morning on the grounded cruise ship in Italy . This morning , the passengers are being offered nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's operator calls it compensation for lost baggage and psychological trauma . The ship fell over two weeks ago of course today after the captain went off course and ran aground . Sixteen people are confirmed dead . Another sixteen are still missing . Now passengers can still sue if they are not happy with the compensation deal . Taking a look at weather , parts of Alabama just ca n't catch a break it seems after being ravaged by tornadoes . The central part of the state is now dealing with flooding . This is what it looked like near Birmingham yesterday ; high water , closed streets , damaged businesses and homes . There 's a little bit of good news here , though . Clear skies should be back today . It is seventeen minutes past the hour , now let 's get a look at your skies on this Friday . Here 's your first check of your local weather . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @!ERICA-HILL: Former hostage Jessica Buchanan 's family is rushing to her side this morning . We will take you to Italy to find out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why there 's concern it could put another American in danger . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Also Captain Sully Sullenberger has the final word on why we have to turn off our cell phones and other electronic devices when we take off and land .

You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!DAN-LE-BATARD @(ESPN2) : Have you ever done Wheel of Fortune a little bit drunk ? @!PAT-SAJAK-@1ESPN2@: Yes . When -- at NBC in Burbank we had a -- a -- a pl -- place called Los Arcos across the street , which is Spanish as you know for the Arcos . And we go and they serve great margaritas . So we would go , Vanna and I would go across and have two , or three , or six and then come and do the last shows and have trouble recognizing the alphabet . They 're really good tapes to get hold of . @!ERICA-HILL: A confession there from Pat Sajak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd actually really like to hear the -- see the tapes , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Oh . @!ERICA-HILL: If they surface . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: And what about Alex Trebek ? Time now to show you some of the- - this morning 's headlines from around the globe . U.S. Today reports Erin Brockovich , environmental activist , played by Julia Roberts in the movie , is investigating teenagers with health issues in one New York town . She thinks they could be affected by chemical spill more than forty years ago . @!ERICA-HILL: The follow-up to a story we brought you earlier this week . It comes with a headline in The Des Moines Register saying the man who claimed a fourteen-million dollar lottery jackpot just before the deadline is now giving up that claim . Lottery officials say the ticket may have actually been stolen . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: From the Los Angeles Times , Wall Street clicks ' like ' on Facebook IPO . The story says if Facebook goes public as expected , investment bankers could get two hundred and fifty million dollars in fees . @!ERICA-HILL: The Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now if a tweet is illegal in one country , Twitter has to block it worldwide . The new policy would allow those tweets except in the country that censors them . @!CHARLIE-ROSE-: Finally , if you 're having trouble believing online reviews , look at this from The New York Times . Some companies are now offering refunds to customers in exchange for positive reviews . @!ERICA-HILL: Mm . American aid worker Jessica Buchanan is going now going through what 's known as reintegration .

##4103555 @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Florida Finale : The immigration battle takes center stage at the last GOP debate before next Tuesday 's primary . @!WOLF-BLITZER: Is he still the most anti-immigrant candidate ? @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1R-: I think of the four of us , yes . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1R-Pr: My father was born in Mexico . My wife 's father was born in Wales . They came to this country . The idea that I 'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Tarmac Tussle : Not a big deal says President Obama of his finger pointing encounter with Arizona 's governor . And Censoring Tweets : Be careful who you tweet for . New twitter technology raises freedom of speech concerns . This is the CBS MORNING NEWS for Friday , January 27 , 2012 . Well , good morning everybody and thanks for joining us . I 'm Betty Nguyen . This morning it looks like the Florida primary is a race that is going down to the wire . With the fo -- just five days away , the latest polls indicate a two-man contest . A new Quinnipiac poll of likely Republican primary voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In last night 's debate , Romney and Gingrich engaged in heated exchanges over immigration , banking and taxes . Susan McGinnis joins us now from Jacksonville with the latest on that . Good morning , Susan . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: Hey good morning , Betty . Well this was the nineteenth Republican debate of the season . And the last one before Tuesday 's primary . Now with Florida so large , so diverse and much more representative of the nation compared with the other contests so far , all the candidates were well aware of what 's at stake . @(Begin-VT) @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1R-Pr: I think you should apologize for it . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: Mitt Romney launched his assault right from the start . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: That 's simply inexcusable . That 's inexcusable. @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: Blasting Newt Gingrich for calling him the most anti- immigrant candidate on stage . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: My father was born in Mexico . My wife 's father was born in Wales . They came to this country . The idea that I 'm anti-immigrant is repulsive . Do n't use a term like that . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: But Gingrich would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage firms that helped trigger the housing crisis . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1R-: We discovered to our shock , Governor Romney owns shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: Have you checked your own investments ? You also have investments through mutual funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: All right . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: The candidates have a lot riding on Florida . The winner of Tuesday 's primary takes all fifty of the state 's delegates ; giving that person a big boost . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1R-: The bigger issue here is these two gentlemen who are out distracting from the most important issues we have by playing petty personal politics . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: Rick Santorum urged the front-runners to focus on the issues , but the bickering continued when it came to Gingrich 's idea of setting up a permanent base on the moon . @!MITT-ROMNEY-: If I had a business executive come to me and say they want to spend a few hundred billion dollars to put a colony on the moon , I 'd say you 're fired . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-: You do n't just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get things done . @!RON-PAUL: I do n't think we should go to the moon . I think we maybe should send some politicians up there at times . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: The jabs are expected to continue through the weekend as the candidates make their final push to win over voters . @(End-VT) @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: Now Rick Santorum and Ron Paul also put in strong performances last night and , Betty , there was one moment of levity . Ron Paul was asked if he would release his medical records . And he said yes , and then he challenged his competitors to a twenty-five-mile bike race . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Yeah I heard there were no takers on that . @!SUSAN-MCGINNIS: No takers. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: All right . Susan McGinnis in Jacksonville . Thank you , Susan . Well President Obama wraps up his three-day campaign swing today with stops in Michigan and Maryland . The President 's focus is energy and jobs . But it is his brief meeting on the airport tarmac in Phoenix , that 's drawing a lot of attention . Randall Pinkston reports . @(Begin-VT) @!RANDALL-PINKSTON: An energized President Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O: Hello , Nevada . @(Crowd-cheering) @!RANDALL-PINKSTON: Funding from his stimulus package helped build this environmentally friendly UPS center . The President is visiting this key battleground state to underscore the need for more clean energy jobs . He also wants to start drilling again for oil in the U.S. now that more oversight is in place after the BP disaster . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O: And today I 'm announcing that my administration will soon open up around thirty-eight million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for additional exploration and development , which could result in a lot more production of domestic energy . @!RANDALL-PINKSTON: But the President 's trip is being overshadowed after a tense encounter with the Republican governor of Arizona . Governor Jan Brewer was photographed Wednesday pointing her finger at President Obama when he arrived in Phoenix . @!GOVERNOR-JAN-BREWE: I 'm animated . I talk with my hands . @!RANDALL-PINKSTON: Brewer gave the President a letter requesting a meeting . He responded that in her book the governor had misrepresented a previous meeting . @!GOVERNOR-JAN-BREWE: I respect the office of -- of -- of the President . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in the White House . @!RANDALL-PINKSTON: Their conversation on the tarmac apparently did n't go much better . The governor says she was in the middle of a sentence when the President walked away . @(End-VT) @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Now if the President is re-elected , it looks like he 'll need to find a new secretary of state . Speaking at the state department yesterday , Hillary Clinton said she is ready for some rest . @!HILLARY-RODHAM-CLI: I think after twenty years and it -- it will be twenty years of being on the high wire of American politics and all of the challenges that come with that . It would be a -- probably , a good idea to just find out how tired I am. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Clinton has been the first lady , served in the Senate , run for President and now heads the state department . North Carolina 's first female governor says she is calling a quit after one term . Democrat Beverly Perdue said she fears her fight with state Republicans over education would become too political . But she also faces a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina critical to President Obama 's reelection . Well , Republicans were quick to criticize the Pentagon 's plan for cutting military spending . The five-year plan was unveiled yesterday as part of a budget cutting deal made with Congress . The Army would shrink by eighty thousand soldiers , Marines by twenty thousand . The Pentagon will ask Congress for five hundred twenty-five billion dollars for its 2013 budget . That is six billion dollars less than this year . @!LEON-PANETTA: The military will be smaller and leaner . But it will be agile , flexible , rapidly deployable and technologically advanced . It will be a cutting-edge force . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says there will be a shift toward more special operations units like the Navy SEALs and improvements in cyber defense . It was an elite team of Navy SEALs that rescued two hostages including an American from Somali pirates . Jessica Buchanan and Poul Thisted were rescued early Wednesday . They 've been flown to a U.S. base in Sicily for a medical treatment . Buchanan 's family is meeting her there . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preventing from leaving the country . The group includes the son of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and others who work for U.S. organizations promoting democracy . The travel ban is tied to political events that led to the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak . The generals who now lead Egypt accuse foreigners of being behind the anti-government protests . All right . So if you tweet , you will be interested in this story . Twitter can now censor messages on a country-by-country basis . The new technology is raising free speech concerns . Here 's how it works . Tweeting containing material that breaks a law in one country can be taken down there but seen elsewhere . Twitter says it will post a censorship notice whenever a tweet is removed . Coming up on the MORNING NEWS , the government is owed billions in back taxes by its own employees . Plus , a disaster caught on tape . People are seen fleeing a massive building collapse . This is the CBS MORNING NEWS . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Check out this dramatic security video from Rio de Janeiro . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings collapsed Wednesday night . First reported as a gas explosion , officials now , say it appears a structural failure that triggered that collapse .

Plus , snack maker Hostess could be headed for trouble with unions . Ashley Morrison is here in New York with that and more . Good morning , Ashley . @!ASHLEY-MORRISON: And good morning to you , Betty . In overseas trading , Tokyo 's Nikkei slipped a fraction following a forecast of big losses for videogame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half a percent . In early trading Thursday , the Dow Jones reached above its highest close since the 2008 financial crisis , but some weak reports on housing and economic growth sent stocks lower to the finish the day . The Dow was down twenty-two points , while the NASDAQ lost thirteen . Today , Attorney General Eric Holder unveils new details about a new fraud fighting unit at the Justice Department . The task force will focus on investigating bad mortgage deals which were a key trigger of the financial meltdown . President Obama announced the unit 's formation during his State of the Union address . In his Tuesday night speech , the President also called on all Americans to pay their fair share . But a new report from the IRS shows tens of thousands of federal government employees owe more than three billion dollars in back taxes . The study found that thirty-six members of President Obama 's executive office are on the hook for more than eight hundred thousand dollars , and nearly seven hundred employees of Congress owe Uncle Sam a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Twinkie maker Hostess . The bankrupt baker is asking a judge to reduce some of its commitments to its union workers . Hostess says cutting its obligations to the workforce is the only way it can emerge from bankruptcy . And speaking of diet busting foods , Taco Bell is getting into the breakfast business . On Thursday , the fast food chain launched a breakfast menu at eight hundred of its restaurants in fourteen western states . Now , if all goes well , Taco Bell will start serving breakfast at all of its locations by 2014 . Betty , can you say breakfast burrito. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: I ca n't wait till 2014 . I 'm starving today . @!ASHLEY-MORRISON: Me too . Sounds good this morning . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Bring it on . Absolutely . All right . Ashley Morrison here in New York . Thank you . Well , NASA has released a new portrait of planet earth . And it maybe the best yet . This sharp image is actually a composite of several pictures taken earlier this month by a new research satellite . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many facets of our ever- changing planet . Boy , that 's a beautiful shot . Well , straight ahead , your Friday morning weather and in sports , the Celtics drive to a stunning comeback against the magic in Orlando . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Time now for a check of the national forecast . Morning rain will gradually turn to snow and ice in northeastern New York and much of New England . Rain and snow will move from the Plains into the Great Lakes region . Rain and thunderstorms will continue in the Southeast especially along the Coast . The Southwest will be mostly pleasant but this weekend , Southern California faces Santa Ana winds gusting to seventy miles an hour . In sports , a homecoming of sorts for the Detroit Tigers , new two-hundred- fourteen-million-dollar slugger . Prince Fielder donned his new Tigers uniform at a news conference yesterday . And he recalled being at old Tigers Stadium in the 1990s when his father , Cecil , played there . @!PRINCE-FIELDER-@1T: I 'm just looking forward to , you know , coming back where I grew up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they 've already said , the fans are really excited . So I 'm just glad , you know , that they -- they remembered me . So I get to come back and , you know , play in front of the fans I kind of grew up with . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: And Fielder brings a big bat to the Motor City . Over the last six seasons , he 's averaged thirty-eight homeruns and one hundred eight RBIs . Now to the NBA , in a big comeback win for the Boston Celtics . At one point , Orlando led by twenty-seven . But in the third period , the Celt 's Paul Pierce had a three-pointer on his way to twenty-four for the night . In the fourth , he sank a jumper to cut the magic lead to four . And the Celtics won it 91 to 83 . And in Los Angeles , the Memphis Grizzlies ' Rudy Gay hit from midcourt to in the first quarter . But the Clippers took charge . Blake Griffin had a reverse slam dunk . Did you see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points for the night . That was impressive . The Clippers won it 98 to 91 . When we return , defending Paterno . As thousands gathered at a memorial on the Penn State campus , one speaker says the former football coach got a raw deal . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Federal investigators are trying to find out who shipped a load of cocaine to U.N . Headquarters right here in New York and why ? The package was from Mexico and it was delivered by DHL earlier this month . And suspicious mailroom workers had it x-rayed . So inside what they found were four -- fourteen , in fact , hollowed out books containing more than thirty- five pounds of cocaine .

In State College , Pennsylvania , a final tribute to beloved Penn State football coach Joe Paterno . Students and alumni joined the Paterno family at a campus memorial service . Manuel Gallegos was there . @(Begin-VT) @!MANUEL-GALLEGOS: Joe Paterno 's widow , Sue , received a warm welcome from a crowd of thousands who gathered to remember the Penn State legend . Paterno made students feel like they were part of something great . @!ANDREW-HANSELMAN-@: He did it with honor , did it with integrity . He never had an ill word . And that 's why he 's Penn State . @!MANUEL-GALLEGOS: And former players say he taught them how to compete with honor and integrity . @!CHARLES-PITTMAN-@1: He was building a proud program for the school , the state and the hundreds of young men he watched over for a half century . @!MANUEL-GALLEGOS: Paterno 's death came less than three months after his sudden firing by the university over the child sex abuse scandal . And some of the bitterness over how he was treated was evident at the memorial . Nike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many were feeling . @!PHIL-KNIGHT-@1Chai: There 's a villain in this tragedy , it lies in that investigation not in Joe Paterno 's response to it . @(Crowd-cheering) @!MANUEL-GALLEGOS: And Paterno 's son , Jay , revealed what many wanted to hear . @!JAY-PATERNO-@1Joe-: Joe Paterno left this world with a clear conscience . He told me he wanted to use his remaining time on earth to see Penn State continue to thrive . He never spoke ill and never wanted anyone to feel badly for him . @!MANUEL-GALLEGOS: Comforting words for Paterno 's family and his community . Manuel Gallegos , CBS News , State College , Pennsylvania . @(End-VT) @!BETTY-NGUYEN: And Michael Jackson cemented his musical legacy long ago . But this morning it is officially set in concrete .

As Anthony Mason reports , much of it can be blamed for its gamble on a single industry . @(Begin-VT) @!ANTHONY-MASON-@1CB: The sign says Fabulous Las Vegas , but it 's not so fabulous these days . Sin City 's economy was built on gaming and tourism , but in the recession that hand was a bust . @!JIM-MURREN-@1Chair: You want to talk about a company town ? This is a company state . @!ANTHONY-MASON: Jim Murren should know . As CEO of MGM Resorts , he runs a dozen resort casinos in Vegas . With fifty thousand workers , MGM is the largest employer in Nevada and its biggest source of tax revenue . @!JIM-MURREN: We alone , one company represents about twelve percent of the entire state budget . @!ANTHONY-MASON: While tourism and gaming revenue are rising again , the state 's largest casinos still lost four billion dollars last year . There are plenty of casualties along the strip . That 's the half-built skeleton of the Echelon , a planned five-hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has never resumed .

Dean Reynolds on the Republican establishment out to stop Newt Gingrich. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: Do you think he 's got any chance to be president ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I hope not . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: An American hostage arrives in Italy for medical treatment . We 'll look at the U.S. Special Forces who rescued her from Somali pirates . Bob Orr has the story . And caught on tape -- staged car accidents and the fake injuries that are driving up the cost of insurance . Armen Keteyian with a CBS News investigation . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ANNOUNCER: This is the CBS EVENING NEWS with Scott Pelley. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: Good evening . We 're beginning tonight with that picture that has caused quite a stir . It shows the governor of Arizona , Jan Brewer , pointing her finger at President Obama as they met on the tarmac yesterday in Mesa , Arizona . The president , and the Republican governor , have disagreements over many things , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The president took issue with the governor 's new book , in which she claims that the president lectured her and was condescending to her in an Oval Office meeting . We spoke to Governor Brewer today about the meeting on the tarmac . Chief White House correspondent Norah O'Donnell has that . She 's traveling with the president in Colorado tonight . Norah . @!NORAH-O'DONNELL-C: Scott , immigration is always a hot-button political issue , but it got personal when the president met with the Republican governor of Arizona . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) O'DONNELL : It 's this picture with the Republican governor 's finger in the president 's face that has Jan Brewer on the defensive today . @!GOV-JAN-BREWER-@1R: I do n't believe I was disrespectful . I went there , again , as I said , with a happy heart to share with him what Arizona has done , with Arizona comeback . O'DONNELL : The confrontation happened on the tarmac after Air Force One landed just outside Phoenix yesterday . @!BREWER: He wants to talk about amnesty . I want to talk about border security . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . O'DONNELL : The president has never advocated for blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants , but does support a path to citizenship for some . And the president and the governor have a history of strained relations over Arizona 's controversial law , which requires Arizonians to carry immigration papers at all times or risk arrest . Under the law , anyone can be stopped on suspicion of being in the country illegally . And the Obama administration is challenging the law in court . In 2010 , the governor requested a White House meeting with the president , and at the time , described it as friendly . @!BREWER: Well , we just completed our meeting this afternoon . It was a very cordial . O'DONNELL : Yet , a year later in her book , she recalled that same meeting quite differently . " It was as though President Obama thought he would lecture me and I would learn at his knee , " she writes . " He was patronizing . " The president clearly did n't like that description and aides say he told the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now accuses the president of being thin-skinned . @!BREWER: Having the most powerful man in the world tell you that he did n't like the way you spoke about him in your book , it takes a little bit away from you . It 's a little breathtaking . O'DONNELL : And this wo n't be the last time the president visits Arizona this campaign year . His call for immigration reform is likely to be popular with Arizona 's growing Hispanic population . @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES: The opponents of action are out of excuses . We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) O'DONNELL : Now , this whole desert dust-up has proved quite a distraction , the president himself tonight saying this is a classic example , Scott , of things getting blown out of proportion . @!PELLEY: Norah , thanks very much . We do n't know if this story will sell papers , but it sure is selling books . Have a look at this . Before she pointed to the president 's face , Governor Brewer 's book ranked number 285,568 on the Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The book is now up to number 21 . Politics is always ruff and tumble . Last year , during the debt debate , President Obama said his young daughters were more responsible than Congress . But in this election year , we 've noticed rhetoric that 's more coarse than we can remember . This was Mitt Romney last week . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!FORMER-GOV-MITT-RO: I 'm someone who believes in free enterprise . I think Adam Smith was right and I 'm going to stand and defend capitalism across this country , throughout this campaign . I know we 're going to hit it hard from President Obama but we 're going to stuff it down his throat and point out it is capitalism and freedom that makes America strong ! @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: We wondered what Bob Schieffer thinks of all of this . He 's our chief Washington correspondent and anchor of " Face the Nation " in Florida tonight . Bob , it seems like it 's not a Democratic or Republican issue , but a question of how the office of the president is treated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , this is just another sign of the growing incivility and really vulgarity of our modern American politics in campaigns . These campaigns have gotten so ugly and so nasty , that they 're now tarnishing the whole system . I think it also underlines , also , the coarseness of our culture in this age of social media , when it is so easy to say anything about anybody , and get no penalty for saying it . But the thing that has always made our system so strong , Scott , is that whatever we have thought of the officeholders , we have held the offices themselves in high respect . We have respected the office . I 've watched a lot of presidents over the years , but I can never recall a president stepping off Air Force One , which is itself a symbol of the presidency in American democracy -- and being subjected to such public rudeness . I think really we 're a better people than this little incident illustrates . @!PELLEY: Bob , thank you very much . With the Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special one-hour edition of " Face the Nation " this Sunday live from Miami . And we did a poll last week , and we asked folks at home if the two parties should compromise to get things done . 85 percent said compromise . It was about the same for both Republicans and Democrats . It is n't the other party that Newt Gingrich has to worry about tonight . The candidate for the Republican presidential nomination has some of the biggest names in his own party turning against him . Dean Reynolds is with the former speaker of the House in Florida . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!DEAN-REYNOLDS-CBS: In Mount Dora today , it was Gingrich against the GOP. @!GINGRICH: Remember , the Republican establishment is just as much an establishment as the Democratic establishment , and they are just as determined to stop us. @!REYNOLDS: Mitt Romney already has establishment figures like Senator John McCain and Governor Chris Christie in his corner . Today , former GOP presidential nominee , Bob Dole , the Senate majority leader when Gingrich was speaker of the House , underlined his support for Romney in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich is the nominee " Dole wrote " It will have an adverse impact on Republican candidates running for county , state , and federal offices . Hardly anyone who served with Newt in Congress has endorsed him , and that fact speaks for itself . " In a recent interview with Rita Braver for " CBS Sunday Morning , " Dole elaborated . @!BOB-DOLE: He 's very bright , very articulate . He 's a good debater . But I found him very difficult to work with . @!RITA-BRAVER-CBS-C: Do you think he 's got any chance to be president ? @!DOLE: I hope not . @!REYNOLDS: More than 70 current members of Congress have endorsed Romney , compared to 11 who are for Gingrich . Trent Lott succeeded Dole as majority leader and was a Republican senator from Mississippi when Gingrich was speaker . @!TRENT-LOTT: He knows how to touch the right hot buttons , and on the stump , he 's good . You got ta give him credit for that . I just do n't think that 's what we need in a president . @!REYNOLDS: With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to cast his lot with the Tea Party movement and style himself as an insurgent battling against the old order . @!GINGRICH: Make no bones about it -- this is a campaign for the very nature of the Republican Party , and the very opportunity for a citizen conservatism to defeat the power of money and prove that people matter more than Wall Street and that people matter more than all of the big companies that are pouring the cash in to run the ads that are false . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!REYNOLDS: And that 's a point we are likely to hear tonight at the debate , Scott , where we 're told the audience will be encouraged to applaud if it wants to . @!PELLEY: Five days to election day there , thanks very much , Dean . If President Obama wins reelection , he may very well have to find a new secretary of state . Today , Hillary Clinton told State Department employees she will stay on until a successor is chosen . She said she is ready for a rest . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HILLARY-CLINTON: I think after 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on the high wire of American politics and all of the challenges that come with that , it would be a -- probably a good idea to just find out how tired I am. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PELLEY: The president 's national security team can expect a robust debate with Congress over the administration 's plan to shrink the military . Today , Defense Secretary Leon Panetta outlined how he intends to save nearly half a trillion dollars over the next decade . The Army would shrink by 80,000 soldiers , the Marines by 20,000 . Pay raises for the troops would be limited . Some bases would be closed . Health insurance fees for retirees would go up , and big-ticket weapons like submarines would be delayed . But the plan calls for expanding the Special Forces . They include Navy SEALs , who swooped into Somalia Tuesday night and rescued two aid workers . One of whom is an American woman . Tonight , both are receiving medical care at a Naval air station in Italy . We asked Bob Orr to tell us more about the men who carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jessica Buchanan and Paul Thisted , seen in this hostage video , were freed by Navy SEALs after a battle that lasted just a few minutes . The mission , named " Octave Fusion , " called for Navy SEAL Team 6 to parachute into central Somalia , surround a camp where the captives were being held and take prisoners if possible . But a Pentagon official says , when one of the Somali kidnappers fired , the commandos opened up . At least eight suspects were killed , and the hostages rescued . The team leader radioed success , with the code word " Jackpot . " It was the kind of surgical strike that defines one of America 's most elite Special Operations Forces . This former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens ... @!ERIC-GREITENS: The enemy has made their choice . If they 're taking Americans hostages , if they 're armed on the battlefield , then they know that the SEALs are going to have to engage with them and use force . @!ORR: SEAL Team 6 was founded as a counter-terrorist force after the failed 1980 mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team 's success has been built on notoriously rugged training . Fewer than 25 percent of the candidates make it through boot camp . There have been celebrated successes . Last May 's raid that killed Osama bin Laden , the 2009 rescue at sea , in which SEAL snipers shot and killed three Somali pirates holding the captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama . The commandos have also , though , taken heavy losses . President Obama honored 22 members of Team 6 who were killed last August when their helicopter was shot down during a night time raid in Afghanistan . Through all of the challenges , Greitens says , SEALs remain resilient . @!GREITENS: If you 're going to be a terrorist who is going to threaten the United States , you know that we have on call a highly trained commando force , and you will never be able to sleep peacefully at night . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!ORR: In military jargon SEAL Team 6 is better known as a tier one force . And Scott , that means they only get the tough ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the name SEAL stands for something . It 's an acronym that refers to the fact that SEALs operate everywhere , by sea , air , and land . A car insurance scam using phony crashes is costing honest drivers . A discovery near the South Pole could fuel debate over climate change . And a mystery for marine experts -- dolphins in danger of being stranded off Cape Cod , when the CBS EVENING NEWS continues . @!PELLEY: In this tough economy , one type of insurance fraud is more popular than ever . It involves scam artists who stage car crashes in order to cash in . Here 's chief investigative correspondent Armen Keteyian. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) ARMEN @!KETEYIAN , CBS C@!ORRESPONDENT: In Tampa , Florida , security cameras outside a business captured an accident , an accident . And SUV slammed into a car . But rewind the tape , and you see the car was actually driven into the middle of the street . The driver got out , a collision , and then five people climbed into the damaged vehicle . The passengers later claimed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , they were arrested and convicted of staging a car accident . Ron Poindexter is the Florida director for the National Insurance Crime Bureau , a not-for- profit agency funded by the insurance industry to investigate fraud . @!RON-POINDEXTER: It 's a big problem nationally . In Florida , it 's a huge , growing problem that 's out of control . @!KETEYIAN: Today , 12 states have what 's known as " no fault " auto insurance . That means no matter who 's at fault , everyone involved in a car accident is entitled to insurance money if they 're hurt . In Florida , it 's up to $10,000 per person . In New York , $50,000 . Payouts are so big , it set the stage for massive fraud . Scammers like this man , who asked we conceal his identity . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: First of all , you 've got to recruit people . You 've got to look around for people who want to do car accident and then you 've got to ask them if they want to be the hitter or the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the one that 's getting hit ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Yes . @!KETEYIAN-@1voice-o: Here 's how it works . It 's run by organizers who own bogus medical clinics . They in turn hire recruiters who find people willing to stage accidents for money . The people involved are then taken to the bogus clinics where this undercover video , shot by Florida state investigators , shows what typically happens next . Here an investigator posing as an accident victim was told to sign one insurance form after another for medical treatment he 'll never receive . He was then paid $700 in cash for faking the accident and an injury . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: And it 's a lot of money . @!KETEYIAN-@1on-came: Is it always the same thing ? Is it a back problem or is it ... @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Yeah , that 's why it was so easy , no matter what you do you 're going to have a back problem . @!KETEYIAN-@1voice-o: This man told us he made about $1,000 for each person he recruited . Investigators say crooked clinic owners can rake in as much as $2 million a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even massage therapists are all involved and all get a cut . @(on-camera) : What 's changed with this kind of no-fault fraud ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: The recession and the economy has created sort of a cottage industry to a point where they 're actually stealing thousands and tens of thousands of dollars and not treating or seeing any patients . ( @!KETEYIAN-@1voice-o: One big reason the industry says no-fault fraud like this scam added an estimated $650 million to the cost of auto insurance in Florida alone last year . Armen Keteyian , CBS News , Tampa , Florida . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: They 've discovered a surprise near the south pole -- a river running under the ice . That 's next . @!PELLEY: Strong wind and heavy rain are hitting the southeast tonight , brought on by a line of powerful storms that had much of the region under a tornado watch today . Downpours flooded sections of Alabama that are still cleaning up from some deadly tornadoes on Monday . The debate over climate change may heat up with this news from Antarctica . A team of scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . Lakes have been discovered in the past , but running water could , the scientist say , mean that the ice is melting . Critics say the source of the water must be found before any conclusions are drawn . And then there is this mystery on Cape Cod . For weeks , dolphins have been getting stranded in the bay near Wellfleet , Massachusetts , and marine experts have no idea why . Nearly 100 beached themselves earlier this month . Many of them died . And today , another 200 were spotted in the bay . It 's not known if they are in any danger . A run of bad luck for the gambling capital of America . That story is next . @!PELLEY: President Obama 's tour of five battleground states in the coming election took him today to Las Vegas , Nevada .

As CEO of MGM Resorts , he runs a dozen resort casinos in Vegas with 50,000 workers , MGM is the largest employer in Nevada and its biggest source of tax revenue . @!JIM-MURREN: We alone , one company , represent about 12 percent of the entire state budget . @!MASON: While tourism and gaming revenue are rising again , the state 's largest casino still lost $4 billion last year . There are plenty of casualties along the strip . That 's the half-built skeleton of the Echelon , a planned five-hotel mega-resort .

##4103557 @!GAYLE-KING: It was a strange sight in the skies over Los Angeles . Our station KCBS TV sent these pictures of LAPD and military Special Forces flying a practice mission last night , and there are more exercises scheduled for today . So if you 're in L.A. and you 're wondering what was up with that last night , now you know . @!ERICA-HILL: Not a whole lot of traffic helicopters . @!GAYLE-KING: Not a whole lot of traffic at all in L.A. yesterday , but the helicopters anyway . Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING . When people in Florida argue over sports , it 's usually about which college has the best football team . @!ERICA-HILL: But now Florida lawmakers are taking on the state 's pro franchises . As Anna Werner reports , it is all about money and an obscure law intended to help the homeless . @(Begin-VT) @!ANNA-WERNER: In the Sunshine State , pro sports are big business , pulling in billions of dollars each year from ticket sales and taxpayers whose money is used to finance projects like this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball stadium that has taxpayers on the hook for everything from a parking lot to property taxes . But according to a little known Florida statute , any professional sports facility constructed with financial assistance from the state shall be designated as a shelter for the homeless . In its twenty- three-year history , the law has never been enforced , and that angers Florida Senator Mike Bennett who has sponsored a bill demanding that teams return the money if they ca n't prove they 've been in compliance with the law . @!MIKE-BENNETT-@1R-F: We should not be taking taxpayers ' money to support these professional sports teams . And the rule was you took the money , you were supposed to have a use for a program for homeless people and you did n't do it . Therefore , we want our money back . @!ANNA-WERNER: Across the state , professional sports teams are estimated to have received over two hundred seventy million taxpayer dollars . But lawmakers like Bennett say teams have done nothing in return . And in the wake of rising ticket and parking prices , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medicaid , we 're cutting money for education , we 're cutting money for homeless programs and shelters and all these other things . We 're saying you know what , maybe we should ask for that money back . @!ANNA-WERNER: In a statement , a Miami Heat spokesperson said that the American Airlines basketball arena has never operated as a homeless shelter " due to the intensity of arena activity and physical layout And the fact that the arena is in a flood and evacuation zone . " Critics say the bill has little chance of passing . But the showdown over taxpayer dollars could have an effect on how new stadiums are built . For CBS THIS MORNING , Anna Werner , CBS News , Miami . @(End-VT) @!ERICA-HILL: Shifting gears now , LOOKING at the state of marriage in America -- husbands and wives nagging their way through marriage . It 's a staple of TV sitcoms. @(Excerpt-from-Marri @!GAYLE-KING: Well , might have been funny for the bundies , but it 's no laughing matter for other couples .

Yes . @!ERICA-HILL: Especially because your wife is watching . @!TOM-PAPA: The happiest married man in America . @!GAYLE-KING: There he is .

In fact , every marriage -- @!GAYLE-KING: Than infidelity ? @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: Infidelity is going to be smaller and so -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm .

It will bring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll our eyes when we think of it , but it really does bring down marriages if you do n't deal with it . @!GAYLE-KING: And you say that nagging has gone multiplatform. @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: Well , this is the thing . @!GAYLE-KING @(overlapping) : And I 'm thinking , why is that ? @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: It used to be , you know , you 'd ask your husband , hey , do something or could you , you know . But now , I can text him and then if he does n't text right back , I 'm going to e-mail him at home , I 'm going to e- mail him at work , I 'm going to call him .

There 's that romance and all that . But when you are in a marriage , what a marriage really is , you -- you get involved with mortgages and all these taking care of pets and you 're running really a thankless nonprofit organization .

But -- @!TOM-PAPA: Yeah . @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: -- there is -- there are reasons women are more attuned . They are sort of the bosses of the home and they 're -- @!TOM-PAPA: Right . @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: -- more in tune . They 've got to get everything done . @!GAYLE-KING: But you have a way -- @!TOM-PAPA: And do n't be a baby about it . You know , you 're a guy . You 're just like the -- when you 're at work , the boss will make you employee of the month once in a while , tell you , you 're doing a good job . You 'll get that . @!GAYLE-KING: No . I think , Elizabeth , you said something I think was really helpful to people , the-I-and-the-you rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for people , when you 're in the middle of a conversation , whether you should use I or whether you should use you and things you should never say ? I thought this was really good . @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: Exactly . This is -- this is over and over -- experts will say this is a good way to have an argument . They are good ways to have an argument and nagging is arguing . So instead of saying you never take out the garbage , honey , you never do this . You say , I would love for you to take out the garbage , honey , and it 's important to me , because it stinks . @!TOM-PAPA: Great . @!GAYLE-KING: Mm-Hm. @!ELIZABETH-BERNSTEI: You know you just -- you want to -- you want to put it on yourself and you want to explain why it 's important to you , I statements . @!TOM-PAPA: The same way I talk to my children . That 's what the husband really is. @!ERICA-HILL: And -- @!TOM-PAPA: You 're like another child in the house . It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all okay . Thank you both . Thank you both . We will never forget her in Fatal Attraction . You remember that Alex character that Glenn Close played . She kept everybody men from being cheater , cheater pumpkin eaters . That was just one of her characters . And she just received an Oscar nomination for her latest . She 'll tell us Albert Nobbs when CBS THIS MORNING continues . But first we 're going take a look at your local weather . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @(Excerpt-from-Alber @!GAYLE-KING: Did you recognize her ? Another year and yet another Oscar nomination for the one and only Glenn Close ; this time it 's for her performance in Albert Nobbs where she plays a woman posing as a man in nineteenth century Ireland . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: It is a role that has been close to her heart for some thirty years . We are pleased to have Glenn Close here this morning . Welcome . @!GLENN-CLOSE-@1Acad: Thank you . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Why this role was such a thing that you had to do ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: Well , I first played Albert over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater Club . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Yes . @!GLENN-CLOSE: So every night you had a very intimate relationship to what was going onstage and what people were feeling in the audience . And every night , the seemingly simple story blindsided the audience emotionally . And I love stories like that that -- that kind of build-up on you and end up really making an emotional connection with an audience . That 's what -- that 's what I think everybody wants is some sort of emotional . @!GAYLE-KING: Everybody 's journey . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Yes . @!GAYLE-KING: Congratulations on your Oscar nomination . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Thank you . @!GAYLE-KING: Please told -- please tell me you were awake and you were watching and you were n't sleeping , and you had no idea or you did n't know it was the Oscar day . Please tell me , Glenn . @!GLENN-CLOSE: No . I was actually having a lovely cup of green tea latte -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yes . @!GLENN-CLOSE: -- around the corner in the -- in the West Village with my husband , and we were talking about probably , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: You can do that , you know . @!GLENN-CLOSE: I know , but -- @!GAYLE-KING: And that 's all @(INDISTINCT) @!GLENN-CLOSE: -- interested in a company like that . And then , you know , the phone rang and I was thinking about algae , and all of a sudden it was Oscar nomination . @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Yep . @!GAYLE-KING: No , because you 've -- you 've had a Tony , you 've had Emmys , but the Oscar nomination , even though you 've had -- you 've been nominated , it 's eluded you . What does it mean to you ? Is there a part of you that thinks on the day of the Oscars , oh , please let them call my name , please ? Do you feel that ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: You know , I -- I have never allowed myself to buy into the winner or loser . @!GAYLE-KING: You have n't ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: I have n't . Because at that level , you know , it -- to me -- @!GAYLE-KING: Because everybody said that . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Everybody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that sounds , you know , unreal but I really feel that . @!ERICA-HILL: You talked about the emotional connection that really hooked you with Albert Nobbs and then hooked the -- hooked the -- the audience . You can see it in your performance . One of the things that was amazing to me is how so much of what we get from you , that connection you seem to create is through your eyes -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mm. @!ERICA-HILL: -- and your face and not even your words some times , but literally , your presence on the screen . How -- how do you perfect that part of your craft ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: I learned quite quickly the power of thought on films . Particularly , in what only film has , which is the close-up . @!ERICA-HILL: Mm-Hm. @!GLENN-CLOSE: And the close-up is a moving , real time representation of some emotion -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Mm. @!GLENN-CLOSE: -- going across a human being 's face . And the greatest challenge for me for -- to do a character like Albert on film was to know that the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Mm. @!GLENN-CLOSE: And this is a woman who has not allowed herself to look into anyone 's eyes for thirty years . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: And your daughter 's in this , too . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Yes . @!GAYLE-KING: What was that like ? What was that like ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: Well , I -- you know , I 'm very proud actually . When people say oh , your daughter wants to be an actress ? I feel like saying , you 're talking about a profession I spent thirty years in. @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . Yeah . @!GLENN-CLOSE: I think I 've blessed by working with phenomenally gifted people and phenomenally generous and to not wish that on my daughter would be -- @!GAYLE-KING: Yeah . @!GLENN-CLOSE: -- it does n't make sense . But the one thing that I worry about is how hard it is for your personal life . @!ERICA-HILL: Mm-Hm. @!GLENN-CLOSE: It 's -- it 's a terrible balancing act . @!GAYLE-KING: Could -- could I just ask you , I know we got to go , about Fatal Attraction because to this day I love the character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now my ex-husband . And I spent many times like @(INDISTINCT) see what can happen to you ? What can happen ? Do you -- do you still find women come up to you and say thank you , Glenn , for that role . Thank you , Thank you . Thank you . @!GLENN-CLOSE: You know , it 's really interesting , it 's mostly men -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mostly men that say thank you ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: -- that come up to me and saying -- @!CHARLIE-ROSE: You 're my nightmare ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: Yeah . And -- and you saved my marriage , or you know -- @!GAYLE-KING: Mostly men ? @!GLENN-CLOSE: I -- yeah . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: And so -- and so why do you like it so much , Gayle ? @!GAYLE-KING: Because I think that it sends such a message for men in particular about how blinking outside the marriage is not a good thing . And so he thought it was going to be a one-night stand . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: Or you 'll end up in the shower . @!GAYLE-KING: Or you 'll end up -- yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go . And I just think it was a great advertisement . I 'm saying nothing personal about my own life here . But -- but I 'm just saying I thought it -- I thought it was a service to many , many people . That 's all I 'm saying , Charlie Rose . @!ERICA-HILL: And unfortunately , we have to leave it at that . @!GAYLE-KING: Okay . @!ERICA-HILL: We 're getting cued to wrapping our ears . Glenn -- @!GLENN-CLOSE: I wo n't be ignored . @!ERICA-HILL: -- thank you . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: You look fantastic . @!GLENN-CLOSE: I wo n't be ignored , Charlie . @!CHARLIE-ROSE: That 's right . @!GAYLE-KING: That 's right . @!ERICA-HILL: Thank you and good luck and congratulations . @!GLENN-CLOSE: Thank you , Charlie . @!ERICA-HILL: Albert Nobbs is in theaters now . @!GAYLE-KING: She wo n't be ignored , Charlie .
