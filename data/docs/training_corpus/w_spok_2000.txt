In that state , as in New Hampshire , the candidates are scrambling to meet the voters face-to-face . Our Phil Jones has also been meeting voters face-to-face in both states . And now as he reports in our cover story , the political search works two ways : While the candidates are looking for votes , the voters are looking for a president . @(Footage-of-Cheryl-) @!Ms-CHERYL-SHEER-@1 : My name is Cheryl Sheer . I am Greene County Democratic chairman . I think we need someone we can trust . I think we need someone that we can look up to , that we would like our kids to look up to . @(Footage-of-Heister) @!Mr-TIM-HEISTERKAMP : Character , integrity , somebody who 's not going to lie on television . @!PHIL-JONES-reporti : @(Voiceover) Tim Heisterkamp is a conservative Iowa Republican who could n't agree more with Democrat Cheryl Sheer about what he 's looking for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want somebody who 's -- who 's open and up front , and be a man or woman of integrity and -- and unbelievable moral character . @(Footage-of-Heister) @!JONES : @(Voiceover) Heisterkamp is a financial adviser . He works and lives in the small town of Jefferson , while Sheer is a farmer , who , with her husband , Steve , cares for cattle and 1,800 acres . Their daily lives differ , but their political struggles are quite similar as they prepare to vote in Monday night 's Iowa presidential caucuses . They have both considered and rejected the party front-runners , George W. Bush and Al Gore . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Gore ; -B @!Ms-SHEER : @(Voiceover) Maybe Gore is part of the establishment , I do n't know , but I do n't think I would feel as comfortable with him .

Excellent . OK . So can I go pretty fast because most all of you ... @!JONES : @(Voiceover) Along with researching the candidates , Tim Heisterkamp has been to a caucus training session to hear the complicated rules . It was also a pep rally on the national role the estimated quarter of a million Iowans will play when they come out tomorrow .

There are 437 fewer farms in just this one county than you saw 30 years ago . Yet even Iowans , who drive by these monuments of the past , share concerns of voters elsewhere . @!Ms-SHEER : Probably the second one would be the health issue , and the third one would be education . qwq @ ( Footage-of-girls ' - Unidentified Man 3 : There it ... @!Mr-HEISTERKAMP : There it is . That 's it , Erin . Unidentified Man 3 : Good job . @!JONES : @(Voiceover) The family means everything to Heisterkamp. @!Mr-HEISTERKAMP : Go deep ! @!JONES : @(Voiceover) This night , it 's his daughter Erin 's basketball game . He 's one of the Republican religious right that made abortion the litmus test for presidential candidates in the past . This year , his big issue is taxes , not abortion . @!Mr-HEISTERKAMP : For me it 's -- it 's a feeling that the government is not going to change people 's hearts . That change has -- has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the government to -- to legislate and force people to be moral , it just -- it 's simply not going to happen . @(Footage-of-Morain-) @!Mr-RICK-MORAIN-@1E : @(Voiceover) I 'm editor , publisher of the Jefferson Bee and Herald . @!JONES : @(Voiceover) Rick Morain 's local newspaper has found one curious change in the Iowa electorate this year . @!Mr-MORAIN : We 're finding that in both parties , the number of undecideds is equal to the total number of people who are willing to say at this point that they favor one candidate or the other . That 's a very unusual thing . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Bradley Former Senator BILL BRADLEY ( Democratic Presidential Candidate ) : I hope you 'll go out and help me on caucus . I want it to be clear that we did better than expected ... @!Mr-MORAIN : @(Voiceover) Iowa 's job , I think , is -- is to winnow the field for the primaries and the caucuses that come after . If they ca n't survive the -- the cut in Iowa , then they 're out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa caucus history , which is , finish lower than third and you 're a goner . @(Footage-of-New-Ham) @!JONES : Here in New Hampshire , the lay of the land could n't be more different from Iowa .

I 'd like your vote . @!JONES : @(Voiceover) With the New Hampshire primary closing fast , no one has learned how dangerous it can be here more than governor George Bush . Just ask him . There was a time when there was no fight here . You had it . Why do you think it has turned into a fight ? @!Gov-BUSH : Well , I think -- one , John McCain is a good man .

Nice to see you . Nice to see you . Unidentified Man 4 : Nice to meet you . @!Mr-McCAIN : John McCain . A pleasure . @!JONES : @(Voiceover) Much of McCain 's surge comes from New Hampshire 's crusty independent voters , who are now the largest block of voters in the state . They may vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary . @!Mr-McCAIN : The question is : What are we going to do about the cost of prescription drugs ? Occasionally I have to come at these town hall meetings and tell you I do n't know the answer , and I have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unidentified Woman : I like the way you answer questions .

The technique is called straight talk , but it 's the message also : reform of the government , reform of the tax code , reform of education , and you ca n't do that unless you get the government out of the hands of the special interests and give it back to the people , and that means eliminating these huge money contributions that corrupted the last election cycle in ' 96 , and poses that same danger to this one . @(Footage-of-childre) @!JONES : @(Voiceover) Mike and Jo-Ann Houde are part of the state 's burgeoning high-tech industry and just the kind of independent voters that all the candidates are looking for .

I will stay here as long as anybody wants to talk with me. @!JONES : Have you decided ? @!Ms-JO-ANN-HOUDE-@1 : Independent and leaning . @!JONES : Leaning where ? @!Ms-HOUDE : Leaning towards Gore . @!Mr-MIKE-HOUDE-@1Ne : I still want to , you know , research it further , see what -- you know , how he differentiates from Bradley and the Republicans . @!Ms-HOUDE : McCain has a lot of good things to stand for , as well , and like Michael , we have n't researched the candidates fully , so just a little bit more researching to do before primary day . @(Footage-of-of-peop) @!JONES : @(Voiceover) After the Houdes left , Al Gore was still inside the gymnasium trying to sell himself to anyone around , including an out-of-state reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far . @!JONES : I mean , you outlasted all of them .

##54058 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ? @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Haiti is beautiful , but it has the -- has long been a nation of intractable poverty and violence . So it 's no reflection on the men and women of the US military whose mission in that island nation is coming to an end , but we have to ask whether theirs is a Mission Accomplished . Our SUNDAY MORNING cover story is reported now by Rita Braver . @(Footage-of-women-w) @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) These women are dragging salt out of the ponds of Grand-Saline , a remote marsh along the northern coast of Haiti . It is backbreaking work . They start at dawn and stop only when the sun gets too high . But a 39-year-old Haitian-American , Edwidge Armand , there in the green shirt , wants to lighten the load for the people of his native village . He longs to build a modern salt processing operation here . @!Mr-EDWIDGE-ARMAND- : This is my land . This is where I was born . My dream here is to help the economy , teach them the be -- a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Haiti 's capital of Port-au-Prince , in a hospital set in one of the city 's worst slums , Dr. Evelyne Ancion Degraff treats a constant stream of children suffering from dysentery , fever and infectious disease . @!Dr-EVELYNE-ANCION- : They live in very poor hygiene conditions . The environment they 're -- they 're living -- they do n't have access to water , good water , and that 's why . @(Aerial-footage-of-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And high on a hill , on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince , in a neighborhood so poor that the streets look like they 've been strafe-bombed , Father Gerard Jean-Juste tries to lift his parishioners ' souls . But in truth , life here is desolate and depressing . Every one of these people once believed that the presence of US forces in Haiti would help lift this nation out of its abject poverty . Father GERARD JEAN-JUSTE ( Haitian Priest ) : Oh , I had great hope . And we thought that we were going to have a taste of heaven on Earth in Haiti . But unfortunately , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : @(Voiceover) It was called Operation Restore Democracy . Five years ago , the US and other western nations forced out Raoul Cedras , the military dictator who had seized control of Haiti , and 20,000 American troops came in to restore order . @(Footage-of-abandon) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But as of tomorrow , the US is abandoning its base in Port-au-Prince , doling out leftover food and equipment to charities in Haiti , and turning over what 's left of the base itself to the Haitian government . A few hundred reserve and National Guard troops will rotate in and out of the country , but only to carry out US training missions . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Kerzie- Major MIKE KERZIE ( US Military ) : Well , I knew there was a possibility of -- of -- of us pulling out of here . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Major Mike Kerzie , who is leaving tomorrow , will not forget the chaos and misery he witnessed beyond the barbed wire fences . Did it make you wish that you could do more ? @!Maj-KERZIE : Yes , ma'am . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the resources you have , but we have literally taken bare ground and -- and have -- have constructed schools , and -- and you hope that a little bit of that education that they learn in those schools will -- will help them expand their economy and help themselves out , because we ca n't be here forever . @(Footage-of-childre) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Indeed , the American military built school buildings like this one at the Mission of Hope . US forces constructed bridges and roads , too . But an estimated $ 2 billion in US assistance over the past five years has turned out to be a drop in the bucket . It has done little to alleviate the wretched conditions in this nation of seven million people . @(Aerial-footage-of-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Haiti is just 600 miles off the coast of the United States , about the distance from New York to Detroit . It is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere . Per capita income is about $ 410 a year . Electricity , running water and even basic sanitation are all rare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children die by the age of five -- 15 percent . Haitians readily admit that they are responsible for many of their own problems . They say that incompetence , corruption and inefficiency are rampant , and there are many raging battles among , and even within , the various political parties . @(Footage-of-Haitian) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Right now , in fact , the government is practically non-existent . Parliament has been dissolved , and new elections are scheduled for March . At the clinic where she works , Dr. Evelyne Ancion Degraff wishes her fellow citizens would learn to cooperate . @!Dr-DEGRAFF : They must want to do something for themselves , and put hands with hands and each other to do something together , Haitian -- all Haitians together . It 's fine that the Americans help Haitians . It 's OK , but also Haitians have to -- they must do something by themselves , also . @!Fr-JEAN-JUSTE : It will take a while . It will take a while . I discovered that . Sincerely , it will take a while , because so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) When SUNDAY MORNING talked with Father Jean-Juste five years ago , he had just emerged from hiding because of his opposition to the political dictatorship , and he was brimming with hope . @!Fr-JEAN-JUSTE : ( From previous interview ) I 'm very grateful to the -- to the troops that have been very , very successful in their mission here in Haiti . We need a lot except on the spiritual level . @!BRAVER : Today , Jean-Juste acknowledges that his people are more free , but he still believes the US could have done more to improve conditions in Haiti . @(Footage-of-city-sc) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And though US officials adamantly deny it , many Haitians charge that the key reason the US wanted to restore democracy in Haiti was so that the Haitian refugees who were flooding the US would not have grounds to seek political asylum . @!Fr-JEAN-JUSTE : It was very cynical . It was just to stop these black refugees from getting to the United States , that 's all . That was the whole issue . But they -- they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) And like the Haitian-Americans who staged a recent march in Florida , many here have noted with sorrow and anger that the US recently sent back a boatload of Haitian immigrants , at the same time much of America seems obsessed with keeping one little Cuban boy . @!Fr-JEAN-JUSTE : It brings us back to the old saying : ' You 're white , you 're welcome . You 're yellow , like the Cuban , they stick around . And you 're black , get back . ' That 's the issue . @!BRAVER : How important does the US consider Haiti ? Well , one measure may be that right now , there 's not even an American ambassador here . Before he left , the last one was asked why so little seems to have changed since the US intervention . His answer : ' Expectations were grossly out of line with Haitian realities . ' @(Footage-of-governm) @!Mr-DON-STEINBERG-@ : @(Voiceover) We 're dealing with a country that has had two centuries of authoritarian regimes , no tradition of human rights . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Don Steinberg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-STEINBERG : The expectations may have been too high . @(Voiceover) The results are undeniable : the principle of restoring the democratically elected government , the success that been achieved in building some of the basic institutions of democracy . @(Footage-of-city-sc) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But the prison and judicial systems are still in disarray . Some new , politically-linked murders have occurred . Crime is on the rise again . Last week , 15,000 citizens marched in the town of Jacmel to protest the killing of two French tourists , a father and daughter , and their Haitian driver . The crowds offered comfort to the French family . @(Footage-of-hillsid) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) What we can not show you is what happened to us in Haiti last week . At gunpoint , thugs took videotape out of our camera , saying we did n't have their permission to take pictures in the neighborhood . Those who would change things are finding it tough going . Edwidge Armand . Why are investors reluctant at this point to really back a project that sounds as exciting as this ? @!Mr-ARMAND : Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . You know , every time you turn around , something is happening . Investors do n't want to invest the money in and two days later find out that there 's no hope . @(Footage-of-women-w) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) You know , there 's some in the US who say , ' OK , we 've done enough . We 've done everything we can , and we should give up on Haiti . ' What 's wrong with that idea ? @!Mr-ARMAND : @(Voiceover) That 's a bad idea . Haiti is waiting to blossom . With the right machinery , the right structure , the right government , the only thing we can do is move forward . With the right people in power , the right ideas , the right investors come down , we 'll be fine . @(Footage-of-Haitian) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But how to get to that point ? Neither Haitian nor US officials seem to have any clear-cut strategy . And this is all that remains of the US base in Port-au-Prince : empty barracks , a basketball hoop , the wind though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind . qwq @ ( Footage-of-signs-o @(Visual-of-SUNDAY-M) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Ahead on SUNDAY MORNING , sunrise over a new era in ancient Egyptian art . @(Announcements)

##54063 FAR OUT Announcer : It 's SUNDAY MORNING on CBS , and here again is Charles Osgood . @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : What was once Far Out is in again . That love-it-or-hate-it decade of the ' 60s is getting a second look these days , both from academics and from visitors to one particular museum . One of those visitors was John Blackstone. @(Vintage-footage-an) @!JOHN-BLACKSTONE-re : @(Voiceover) When they remember the ' 60s , many people believe the best thing about that time is that it 's over . Unidentified Woman 1 : ( From vintage footage ) A whole different mu -- band , you know , all at the same time is just going to be too much . I mean , the vibrations are just going to be flowing everywhere . @(Vintage-footage-an) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) Countless baby boomers have put away their tie-dyed T-shirts , and now insist they never inhaled either . So it may come as a shock that artifacts from this age are being rediscovered as art . From embroidered blue jeans to an unlikely hash pipe , the handiwork of the hippies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art . And you wore jeans that looked like this ? Unidentified Woman 2 : Sure did . Unidentified Man 1 : Makes me feel young again . Unidentified Woman 3 : Makes me feel old . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) If part of the job of an art museum is to make us think , this show is making people think back . Unidentified Woman 4 : It 's a symbol , Brian . @!BRIAN : I know . I know that . Unidentified Woman 4 : It 's a symbol of the war , of what -- what most of us did not believe in. @!BRIAN : I know . I was just ... @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) It took somebody who was n't actually part of the ' 60s to discover the value in all this . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!Mr-AARON-BETSKY-@1 : @(Voiceover) People started rediscovering ways of making things that their grandparents had known . @(Footage-of-Betsky-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) The show was put together by curator Aaron Betsky , who was born too late to be a flower child himself . @!Mr-BETSKY : This is really a period when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a series of shared ideas and ideals , and produced work together that really stunned the world . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) The world may have been stunned , but it never took this swirling psychedelia very seriously . Curator Betsky , however , sees what others may have missed in a beaded shoe or a crocheted halter top . @!Mr-BETSKY : And so for instance , there are the lace doilies that are used for the breasts . And you can still see the body implied by the shape . But by hanging it in this way you really begin to concentrate on just the skill with which it was made , the beautiful patterns and layerings of color that a dress like this has . I mean , I 'm a curator . I take this stuff very seriously . @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) Betsky admits his academic rigor sometimes goes too far . @!Mr-BETSKY : @(Voiceover) And I have to sometimes stop myself and say , ' You know , it was meant to be fun , and it was meant to be work that was n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against classification , and here I am trying to classify it . ' @(Vintage-footage-an) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) The major classifications , of course , are sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . This is ... @!Mr-BETSKY : ... Janis Joplin 's Porsche . This is a collection of memories and dreams all together on this car . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : It should n't be surprising , perhaps , the largest item in the show is an elaborately decorated bed , a cultural icon , reminding us there is good reason it was called the summer of love . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) Then there 's that hash pipe . There may be some cities in which a museum curator could get in some trouble . @!Mr-BETSKY : Serious trouble . That 's possible . @!BLACKSTONE : Yeah . @!Mr-BETSKY : Look , drugs were part of this world . There 's no denying it . @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) No denying it at all . When you look at the throne ... When you first laid your eyes on this , what did you think -- what ... @!Mr-BETSKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Like a lot of ' 60s art , the throne did n't get much respect in recent years . @!Mr-BETSKY : We had to clean it up a bit . There used to be an iguana that lived on the top of it . @(Voiceover) It 's just a spectacular piece . It was made by a woman who then called herself Lotus Carnation . @(Footage-of-Lois-An) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) Lotus Carnation she still remembers when inspiration struck . @!Ms-LOIS-ANDERSON : It was just zap . You know , like Zap ! comics . ' I 'm going to make a throne . ' @(Vintage-photograph) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) She stopped calling herself Lotus Carnation sometime in the ' 70s , but Lois Anderson is still a practicing glue artist , sticking stones and beads and Buddhas wherever they seem to work . In the ' 60s , she says , there were always plenty of ideas . Inspired by ? @!Ms-ANDERSON : Inspired by LSD , mostly . We never took the bad stuff . @(Footage-of-artwork) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) But she says she never actually glued under the influence . @!Ms-ANDERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during that period , that we were stoned out of our mind while we were doing it . But our classic answer is there 's no way you can do this picky , picky work and be -- have a blown mind . @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) The excesses of the ' 60s did claim casualties . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) But this show celebrates those who made it through . @!Ms-ANDERSON : I survived . @!BLACKSTONE : Do you miss those days ? @!Ms-ANDERSON : Well , I do because I get nostalgic for them because every day was a happening . @(Vintage-footage-an) @!Ms-ANDERSON : I was an adult when I joined them , an adult librarian , and I looked over at the hippies in San Francisco , I was living there , and I said , ' They 're having more fun than I am . I think I 'm joining them . ' @(Vintage-footage-an) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) San Francisco was the heart of the ' 60s art scene , a city wrapped in a counterculture dream . All the pieces for this show were found in bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco . @!Mr-BETSKY : @(Voiceover) This work was made by people for themselves or for their friends . This was very much work in which people said , ' We do not like the world we 've inherited . ' It is a world that is plastic . It 's a world that is waging war in Vietnam . And we think we can make a better world . Let 's build our own houses , make our own clothes , make our own images . @(Footage-of-museum-) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) Betsky discovered that many of the artists have never really given up the ' 60s dream . @!Mr-BETSKY : They still believe that money 's not what it 's all about . What you make is what it 's all about . And how you make things and what you make out of your own life is what it 's about . @(Vintage-footage-an) @!BLACKSTONE : @(Voiceover) But that 's an ideal that , like much of this art , failed to win many converts . In a city now dominated by high tech and dot-com , it seems quaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco dreaming not of stock options in their portfolio but of flowers in their hair . @(Visual-of-SUNDAY-M) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Talking politics next on SUNDAY MORNING . @(Announcements) 
##54065 CHARLES @!OSGOOD , host : When the United Nations Security Council debated a proposed peacekeeping force for the Congo this past week , it did so against a backdrop of years of failed missions . And the man responsible for those missions : UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who for most of the past decade was the undersecretary in charge of peacekeeping . This morning , we inaugurate a new SUNDAY MORNING feature . We call it Sunday Profile . And to begin , " 60 Minutes ' " Mike Wallace has a profile of a man in the middle . We must warn parents that some of the pictures that follow are upsetting . @!MIKE-WALLACE-repor : Secretary-General , how frustrated do you get by the pattern of putting UN peacekeepers into dangerous situations with insufficient firepower , insufficient manpower ? Secretary-General KOFI ANNAN ( UN ) : Frustrated and sometimes angry . @(Footage-of-refugee) @!WALLACE : ( Voiceover ) He 's got a lot to be angry about if you look at UN peacekeeping failures in the 1990s . The biggest catastrophe , of course , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting 100 days killed 800,000 people . And you were the undersecretary-general ... Secretary-General ANNAN : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . @!WALLACE : ... in charge of peacekeeping at that time . And you 'd been warned that this genocide was coming . Secretary-General ANNAN : Yes . I was the head of peacekeeping operation at the time . @(Footage-of-cable) Secretary-General ANNAN : ( Voiceover ) My military advice -- I did receive a cable from our field commander saying that there may be attempts to kill people . @(Footage-of-refugee) @!WALLACE : The fact is in the months before the massacre , the UN in Rwanda and New York had several such warnings and it passed them on to the US , French and Belgian ambassadors in Rwanda . But the Western powers had no stomach for intervention and did little to prevent the slaughter . Why ? Because just months before in another African country , Somalia , America 's humanitarian mission had turned into a fatal fiasco . Eighteen US Army rangers killed , the corpse of one of them dragged through the streets of Mogadishu . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first priority for the small UN contingent there was not to save Rwandans but to save themselves . Secretary-General ANNAN : These armies do not belong to the United Nation , these armies belong to governments , who , today , do not want to take risks . The politicians do not want to explain to the public that body bags are coming back . @!WALLACE : Just a year ago , Secretary-General , you said that you had no regrets about your own performance in the Rwanda horrors . Now , however , you say , ' All of us must bitterly regret we did not do more to prevent it . On behalf of the UN , I acknowledge this failure and express my deepest remorse . ' What were your own failures ? Secretary-General ANNAN : I regret that we could n't have done more . I did what I thought was the maximum . We approached 80 countries to get troops and we could n't get them . @!WALLACE : From 80 countries . Secretary-General ANNAN : Eighty countries . That 's right . @!WALLACE : Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other countries might have been more forthcoming ? Secretary-General ANNAN : When you talk to Africans , they see a double standard . They see a double standard when they look at what happened in Bosnia and what happened in Kosovo and the resources that were supplied to those crises . And the way the international community responded to the crisis in Rwanda . @!WALLACE : So what you 're saying is , yes ... Secretary-General ANNAN : Had they ... @!WALLACE : ... had they been white , conceivably , there would have been a more useful response in Rwanda ? Secretary-General ANNAN : Yeah . I agree with you . Yeah . @!WALLACE : Let 's move on to Srebrenica . Secretary-General ANNAN : Mm-hmm . @!WALLACE : 1995 , just a year later after Rwanda , a so-called UN safe haven ... Secretary-General ANNAN : Mm-hmm . @!WALLACE : ... of Srebrenica was the site of another massacre . @(Footage-of-bodies) @!WALLACE : ( Voiceover ) This time 7,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred by Serb troops . This , despite warnings ahead of time that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect them , right ? Secretary-General ANNAN : That 's correct . @!WALLACE : Again , peacekeeping . Secretary-General ANNAN : And you know the history of it , the forces that we indicated from the beginning would be required if these safe havens were to be effective . @!WALLACE : Mm-hmm . Secretary-General ANNAN : You would have required 34,600 soldiers . The Council gave us seven -- 7,000 soldiers . @!WALLACE : You -- you needed 34,600 ? Secretary-General ANNAN : That 's right . @!WALLACE : And you got seven ? Secretary-General ANNAN : And even the 7,000 , countries with capacity did not offer . It took us about a year to get them in. @(Footage-of-refugee) @!WALLACE : ( Voiceover ) Nonetheless , the UN assured the Bosnian Muslims they would be protected . Many critics maintain that if the UN had called in air strikes , they could have easily stopped the Serbs and prevented the slaughter . But the UN 's indecision , plus communications foul-ups , delayed the air strikes until it was too late . Secretary-General ANNAN : In operations , then s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes do occur , but this was a very serious one . @!WALLACE : And your reward , as undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping , was to get the top job , becoming secretary-general . Secretary-General ANNAN : No -- no -- let me -- let me say that I do n't think you can make that delect -- direct link of what happened in that particular situation to how the membership decides who becomes secretary-general or not . @(Footage-of-Annan) @!WALLACE : ( Voiceover ) In fact , Annan believes that UN members would not have made him secretary-general if they had thought that his peacekeeping operations were solely to blame for Rwanda and Srebrenica . And now by releasing reports on the UN 's failures there , Annan has been praised for his devastating frankness . Secretary-General ANNAN : If one does not analyze one 's mistakes , if one does not look back and have a sense of history , how else do you have vision ? How else do you improve this ? @!WALLACE : Now you 're secretary-general , and we move to East Timor . @(Footage-of-violenc) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of East Timorese who had voted for independence in an election supervised by the United Nations . And today the UN is undermanned once again , this time in Kosovo . UN member nations had pledged to send almost 5,000 police there to protect the Serbs from revenge by the Kosovars , but so far UN countries have sent fewer than half the promised police . And despite a drop in the number of revenge murders , Kosovars are still killing several Serbs each week . Your own man on the ground there , Bernard Kouchner ... Secretary-General ANNAN : Kouchner . @!WALLACE : ... calls it a scandal . Secretary-General ANNAN : He has a tough job on his hands . And , you see , even throughout this conversation , we keep using the term ' the UN , ' the U -- the UN . Who is the UN ? What -- what is a UN ? UN is its member states . UN does not have a police force . @!WALLACE : That 's right . Secretary-General ANNAN : The police has to come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no appetite . Your government , mine , anyone around the world . There are so many good things that the UN can do and does , World Health Organization , UNESCO , UNICEF . Secretary-General ANNAN : UNICEF . Refugees , development issues . @!WALLACE : Why not keep the UN to -- to doing that kind of thing and get out of the business ... Secretary-General ANNAN : I do -- I ... @!WALLACE : ... the frustrating business of keeping or enforcing the peace ? Secretary-General ANNAN : Yeah . And let the fires burn ? And you think that public opinion ... @!WALLACE : They 're going to burn anyway , apparently . Secretary-General ANNAN : You think the public opinion , and the governments would accept that ? But you 've seen situations where governments and the public have demanded action . And when governments have to do something and they can not do it individually , they come to the UN , which is fine . But then they must follow through and give their resources and maintain the will and the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they do n't do that . They do n't . Secretary-General ANNAN : In some situations that -- they -- they have . But you 're right . They -- often the lack of will has been one of the major cri -- problems we have . @!WALLACE : Are you a world leader or are you hired help ? Secretary-General ANNAN : I do n't see myself as a hired help . And I do n't -- I see -- in fact , I have often been asked that question , are you more a secretary or a general ? And I have -- I 've answered that this is a job that requires both . @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE : ( Voiceover ) But today , Mr. Annan concedes , world leaders do not have the moral clout they used to . Secretary-General ANNAN : And so the question is what has happened to our society where people in political and important positions are not looked up to the way they used to ? What has gone wrong ? What is important to us , our society ? Whom do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

##54067 ON THE FRONTIER @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : There is always an air of excitement and hope On The Frontier , particularly when the frontier of which we speak is medical . Hardly a day goes by , it seems , without word of a new discovery that could put an end to some chronic form of human suffering . Perhaps the newest of these frontiers is gene therapy . But there can be uncertainty , risk , and outright danger on that frontier as well , more so than a lay person might ever imagine . Jerry Bowen reports our cover story . @(Footage-of-Paul-Ge) @!JERRY-BOWEN-report : @(Voiceover) When Paul Gelsinger led mourners up the winding mountain trail near his Tucson home last fall , he did n't know that the experimental gene therapy that killed his 18-year-old son Jesse should never have taken place . @!Dr-STEVE-RAPER-@1R : Large was his bounty and his soul sincere ... @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) He did n't know , as he listened to surgeon Steve Raper mourn the boy 's loss , that the University of Pennsylvania researcher would soon be accused , with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Gelsinger could not possibly have known , as he spread his son 's ashes to the wind , that the nightmare he was living then would get even worse . @!Mr-PAUL-GELSINGER : Thank you , son . @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) But it did . @!Mr-GELSINGER : We can not allow what happened to Jesse to happen again . @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) This past week he told his story to a Senate subcommittee investigating Jesse 's death . @!Mr-GELSINGER : He trusted me . I trusted them . And I was n't given all the information , and some of the information I was given was not true . @(Photograph-of-Jess) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) When Jesse Gelsinger walked into the University of Pennsylvania hospital , his rare liver disease was already under control with diet and 35 pills a day . He did n't need the procedure that , in theory , would replace his bad genes with good ones . He did n't have to do this . @!Mr-GELSINGER : No , he did n't , and even ... @!BOWEN : He could still be here ... @!Mr-GELSINGER : Sure ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all up . @(Photographs-of-Jes) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) But Jesse volunteered anyway , believing his outcome might help newborns with the disorder . His father says they went ahead , even though the consent form listed possible risks , from liver failure to life-threatening inflammation . @!Mr-GELSINGER : I did notice those . Unidentified Reporter : You did . @!Mr-GELSINGER : They were downplayed , though . Unidentified Reporter : By whom ? @!Mr-GELSINGER : It was Steve Raper who made the presentation to us . He went through the whole consent form with us . I felt like it was safe . I did n't have a great concern with it at all . @(Visual-of-report-f) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) According to an @!FDA-investigation , the University of Pennsylvania researchers did not disclose previous toxic reactions in humans , or the deaths of test animals in similar experiments , did not properly inform the Gelsingers of the risks . In all , 18 violations of government rules were uncovered , including using Jesse , even though his liver function was below minimum guidelines . @(Graphic-on-screen) @!FDA-# Toxic reactions Animal deaths Improper consent form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!FDA-ordered the entire Penn program shut down . But Penn , it turns out , is only part of a larger problem . @!Dr-AMY-PATTERSON-@ : Investigators must report any serious adverse event immediately . @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) Dr. Amy Patterson heads the oversight office at the National Institutes of Health . Researchers are required to notify NIH of any deaths or adverse reactions , but only after Jesse 's death did NIH learn that in the past seven years , just 5 percent of such incidents had been reported , just 39 of nearly 700 serious adverse reactions that occurred . @!Dr-PATTERSON : It 's obvious that there is -- has been widespread noncompliance with the NIH guidelines reporting requirements , and that 's unacceptable . @(Footage-of-FDA-s) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) The @!FDA-also requires such reports , but unlike NIH , rarely makes the reports public , in part at the request of biotech companies wanting to keep their gene therapy advances secret . Jesse 's death may change that . @!Ms-H-STEWART-PARKE : So I -- I feel very comfortable about the -- speaking for the industry , that we can meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets . @(Footage-of-researc) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) H. Stewart Parker , who heads a biotech company , says the industry would not oppose greater disclosure if current rules are n't working . @!Ms-PARKER : There 's more oversight over gene therapy than over any other sector of the pharmaceutical business right now . And let 's focus on making sure people follow the rules first , and then let 's see if we need any additional rules . @(Footage-of-Waxman) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) California Congressman Henry Waxman , an advocate for greater oversight , believes both government regulators and the biotech industry share the blame for an oversight system that does n't work . Representative HENRY WAXMAN : I think the problem is on -- on the government side , because the government should be demanding this information . It 's also with some of the companies , because they do n't want their investors to know that maybe their research is n't succeeding early on . And they just do n't want anybody to particularly know about their failures , only about their successes . @(Footage-of-researc) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) But the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Researchers who have a financial stake in the outcome when , and if , manipulating genes becomes the common cure for everything from cancer to heart disease . @!Dr-RUTH-MACKLIN-@1 : Many of the researchers own substantial amounts in the companies , in the biotechnology companies . @(Footage-of-Macklin) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) Dr. Ruth Macklin , bioethicist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine . @!Dr-MACKLIN : These are investigators and researchers who started out in academia and ended up founding companies , and essentially holding a huge share . So they have -- I would say this is a straightforward conflict of interest that one does n't see in other areas of medical research . @(Footage-of-Milstei) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) Gelsinger family attorney Alan Milstein agrees . He believes Jesse died because of an atmosphere of greed . Milstein is exploring a lawsuit . @!Mr-ALAN-MILSTEIN-@ : I 've used the phrase ' NASDAQ medicine ' to de -- to describe what this field sometimes becomes , where the race is not just for the cure , but it 's for the next IPO. @(Footage-of-Gelsing) @!Mr-GELSINGER : I have read that my son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field as ' a pothole on the road to gene therapy .

##54072 SUNDAY PROFILE @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Sometimes it takes a visitor from another place to make you see your own familiar local setting with new eyes . The same thing goes for our familiar national heroes . On this weekend of Abraham Lincoln 's birth , a new book by a noted British author is casting that most familiar of presidents in a fresh light . But then again , perhaps that 's to be expected . As Tom Fenton is about to show us in our Sunday Profile , there 's nothing predictable about this writer and her long and complex life 's journey . @(Footage-of-seashor) @!TOM-FENTON-reporti : @(Voiceover) Criccieth is a beautifully desolate spot , a small community on the far fringes of Wales , where time seems frozen somewhere in the mid-19th century . It 's an ideal place for a writer to live , but an unlikely choice for one who has spent a lifetime capturing the heartbeat of city life around the world . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!Ms-JAN-MORRIS-@1Au : This used to bring the servants up from the fields , but if you ring it now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast that draws 74-year-old Jan Morris here . @!Ms-MORRIS : There 's none of the fizz and the sparkle of urban life , and I 'm very fond of cities , as a result , I suppose , partly , I 've always lived in the bowels of the country , so I love going to cities . And cities , rather than countries , has really been my subject . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) Venice , Hong Kong , Oxford , Sydney , Los Angeles , Manhattan : Morris has visited and written about them all . Cities are her passion , but she 's very clear about what she is not . @!Ms-MORRIS : I hate being called a travel writer , and I do n't believe I am one . When I go to a place , I describe its effect upon my own sensibility . I do n't -- I 'm not telling the reader what they 're going to find there , I 'm just telling people what effect the place has had on me . Everything I 've written is ... qwq @ ( Footage-of-Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-volume account of the British Empire , " Pax Britannica , " is a classic . Morris has crossed dozens of frontiers and traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to gather material for more than 40 books . But this deeply sensitive writer has also made another , more extraordinary , journey , a long personal odyssey in which she eventually crossed another frontier , the gender frontier . @(Footage-of-picture) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) In 1972 , Morris , who was born a male , underwent a sex change operation and became a woman . @!Ms-MORRIS : It simply resulted in me , so to speak . @!FENTON : Right . @!Ms-MORRIS : But it is unquestionably a different me , and to my mind a more interesting me than if I had n't gone through it at all . I 've long ago given up being offended when people ask me about it , but I -- I do object to it being dragged in , for example , when I write a book about the British Empire . It does n't seem to me much matter what 's happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've noted yourself that you know what the headline 's going to be on your obituary . @!Ms-MORRIS : I forget what it is now -- what is it ? @!FENTON : Well , ' Sex-change author dies . ' @!Ms-MORRIS : Oh , yeah , that 's right . Sure to be , absolutely . @(Photographs-of-Mor) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) The gentle lady writer in Wales seems a long way from the gentleman correspondent of the London Times . James Morris , married and a father , was one of the crack foreign correspondents of his day . In 1953 , he accompanied the British expedition to Mt . Everest , and on the day of the coronation of Elizabeth II , he scooped the world with the news that they had reached the summit . @!Ms-MORRIS : That -- that -- that -- that was -- really was rather good , I must say , though I say it myself . It was a truly old-fashioned scoop , out of the 19th cen -- out of Evelyn Waugh , really , you know , because now climbing Everest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of people have been up to the top , and they have , taken up by guides . @(Footage-of-mountai) @!Ms-MORRIS : @(Voiceover) But then to be the first people to get to the summit , though , it was really something . It was like going to the moon , really . @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) And the skills she developed as a reporter were to stand her in good stead for the rest of her writing career . What was it the minister of national guidance of Sudan told you ? @!Ms-MORRIS : He said my task was to produce thrilling , attractive and good news , coinciding , where possible , with the truth . And that 's what I 've tried to do ever since . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!Ms-MORRIS : Now these are all biographies . I 'm interested in people 's lives , as you know . @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) But her feelings towards the subject of her latest book were more complicated . @(Footage-of-statue-) @!Ms-MORRIS : He looks skinny , does n't he ? He looks rumpled , he has n't got a tie on , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , how he looks , how he stands , what people are thinking about him . He 's his own man , which is one of the reasons I 'm very fond of him . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) Touring the United States as a scholarship student in the 1950s , Morris was initially put off by the Lincoln legend . @!Ms-MORRIS : You know , when I first went to America and I got fed up with the old boy because everybody rammed him down my throat , really , and he seemed to be regarded as such an immaculate saint , and that -- I was young and I was European , and that repelled me , rather . I -- I turned against him to begin with . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) But now , late in life , she has revisited the 16th president and found a more human Lincoln . You visited Lincoln in a way , the same way you visit a city . @(Footage-of-statue-) @!Ms-MORRIS : @(Voiceover) Very much so , yes , using the same technique and equally describing Lincoln not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to me , the effect he had on me. @(Footage-of-the-cov) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) " A Foreigner 's Quest " traces Lincoln 's life from Springfield , Illinois , to Washington , DC. @!Ms-MORRIS : @(Voiceover) When he went from here to the White House , they s -- there 's a photograph of him , I think , sitting somewhere here , writing out his own labels on his baggage . And what he put was ' A. Lincoln , the White House , ' and that seems to me stylish . @(Footage-of-Lincoln) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) Morris imagines what history fails to record , filling in details that are plausible , and , where possible , coinciding with the truth . @!Ms-MORRIS : I imagined the ladies in these houses gossiping , you know , about how the -- the Lincolns could never keep a maid for more than 10 minutes , and that because the children were such a handful . And then he used to come to the door in his shirt-sleeves and slippers , which rather shocked the people around here . @(Footage-of-Lincoln) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that he had a nasty side to him , Lincoln . One of the sides -- one of the aspects of that was a sort of manipulative , rather wily kind . But I like to think , well , he was a politician . That 's the way that politicians behave . @(Footage-of-statue-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) But he is thrilling and attractive . @!Ms-MORRIS : He lived in Springfield for 25 years I think it was , and , of course , a great crowd came down to see him leave in his special train . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) Now Morris is thinking of her own farewell , a farewell to a long and successful writing career . Her anchor throughout her life has been her former wife , Elizabeth , whom she now calls her sister-in-law . They live a simple domesticated life with Ibsen , the cat . @!Ms-MORRIS : @(Voiceover) Clearly it has been a tangled life , but it has been an extraordinarily happy one , you know . I 've had a marvelous time . We love each other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a way , is the most important part of anybody 's life -- Is n't it ? -- I suppose ; in my case , the second most important part , because the most important part of my life has been writing books . @(Footage-of-Morris-) @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) She thinks she has one more good book in her , and then happy final years in Wales , where this wandering writer now feels most at home . @!Ms-MORRIS : It 's a very fascinating people . They 're a very complex and an interesting , elusive people . And also the history of Wales itself is very complex and interesting . I do n't like straightforward histories . I like them involved , and Wales is a wonderfully involved one , which still emerges . In -- in Wales I , anyway , feel more that history evolves around me than it does almost anywhere I go . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Wales ; - @!FENTON : @(Voiceover) It has been a long road for Jan Morris , born James Morris .

##54073 DRIVING WHILE BLACK @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : This past week , the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the Los Angeles Police Department , alleging that it had stopped motorists solely on the basis of their race or driving while black , to use the non-legal vernacular . The specific allegations in this suit join a long list of similar accusations aimed against police in Los Angeles and in other cities , too . And however much the police may insist that they do n't do that , an awful lot of black citizens will tell you otherwise . Rita Braver reports our cover story . @(Footage-of-sunset-) @!Ms-SHERYL-CRAYTON : I wa -- I was n't even treated like an adult , much less human . It truly was an injustice done to us , and ... @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) What Sheryl Crayton and two friends from out of town had planned last July was a relaxed outing to Venice Beach , this funky Los Angeles neighborhood . What they got instead was a frightening encounter with the Los Angeles Police Department . @(Footage-of-Crayton) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Driving to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car . So this is where it happened , right here ? @!Ms-CRAYTON : This is where it happened . @!BRAVER : And where exactly were you standing ? @!Ms-CRAYTON : So I was about right here , and then I looked and I see a lot of police cars , and rifles pointed at me. @!BRAVER : Police cars ? And you saw rifles ? They had their guns drawn ? @!Ms-CRAYTON : They had their guns drawn . @!BRAVER : And at what point did they tell you what was going on ? They ... @!Ms-CRAYTON : I said , ' What 's wrong ? What did I do ? ' ' Lie down on the street , ' the officer say , and then the female officer came and put her knee in my back and handcuffed me. @(Footage-of-Califor) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Crayton says the police on the scene never told her why they singled out her car , just that they 'd checked her license plate and found a one-digit discrepancy that made them suspect the car might be stolen . It turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe they did all of this for a license plate . Can you imagine ? For a license plate , they put guns on me and handcuffed me and had me lie in the street ? @(Footage-of-traffic) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Seven months later the police told us they ran the license tags because they thought Crayton had made an illegal turn . But she never received even a warning about that . Commander David Kalish , department spokesperson , defends his officers ' tactics . Commander DAVID KALISH ( LAPD Spokesperson ) : In their mind , they had reasonable suspicion that the individuals in that vehicle may in -- be involved in a crime specifically related to grand theft auto , a stolen car . @!BRAVER : I just want to be clear , though . The officers do have some discretion . They do n't have to order people down on the ground . @!Cmdr-KALISH : Correct . @!BRAVER : They can make their own decision . @!Cmdr-KALISH : Right . @!BRAVER : So it 's not always the procedure , is it ? @!Cmdr-KALISH : Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still come to me and say , ' Ms. Crayton , was that you ? ' @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Crayton believes she and her friends were victims of racial profiling , stopped simply for driving while black . You 're convinced that they took a tougher tact because they saw three African-Americans ? @!Ms-CRAYTON : I believe so . I do n't see any other reason for why . What other reason was there ? We were n't speeding . We did not make an illegal turn . My car is n't banged up . The tag was n't hanging off . What other reason ? @(Footage-of-Crayton) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Crayton is a school administrator . And her two friends , from Portsmouth , Virginia ? Well , Wayne Person is a high-ranking naval procurement official , and his wife , Alotha Willis , is a family court judge . Now all three have filed federal civil rights suits charging that a white person would have been treated differently , better and with more respect than they were . @!Mr-WAYNE-PERSON : I think that this happens all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you know , we have to do . @!BRAVER : In other words , you feel as if in -- in many cases , that because you 're a black person walking around or driving around , that maybe somebody 's going to look at you a little harder ... Judge ALOTHA WILLIS : Well ... @!BRAVER : ... look at you differently ? Judge WILLIS : ... I had not , prior to this point . I mean , I felt relatively shielded . But that -- that was n't part of my experience . But it -- it became a real tangible example , a living example for me , for the things that I hear about in court . @(Footage-of-Yagman-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Their lawyer is Stephen Yagman , who 's made a career out of suing the LAPD. @!Mr-STEPHEN-YAGMAN- : This is a very big deal , because Americans were treated in a way that was unconstitutional because it was based on their race . @(Footage-of-Kalish) @!BRAVER : Did the fact that they were African-Americans in that car make a difference ? @!Cmdr-KALISH : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that 's almost an insulting question . @!BRAVER : Really ? @!Cmdr-KALISH : Absolutely . When we look at our enforcement efforts , they 're clearly color blind . @(Footage-of-Rodney-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) The Rodney King beating helped give the Los Angeles Police Department a reputation for racism that 's been reinforced over the years . Unidentified Officer : Show time . Let 's go to work . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Kalish insists racism is not a hallmark of the LAPD. @!Cmdr-KALISH : In Los Angeles , it is our policy and our training , and as far as our enforcement actions , that we do not engage in rasal -- racial profiling. @!BRAVER : Like racism in the rest of American society , racial profiling is often subtle and complicated by questions of perception . A police officer may claim to be acting on instinct , while the person stopped believes it is due to racism . And tension between police and minorities is exploding far beyond the boundaries of Los Angeles . Unidentified Man : What do we want ? Group of Protesters : Justice ! Unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protesters : Now ! @(Footage-of-protest) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) New York is now embroiled in the trial of four officers for the shooting death of Amadou Diallo . Officers fired 41 shots at the unarmed man in the mistaken belief that he was a rape suspect and that he was reaching for a gun . Critics call it a racist murder . @(Footage-of-emergen) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) The US Justice Department has charged that New Jersey state troopers singled out minority drivers for traffic stops . In Providence , Rhode Island , last month , white police officers mistakenly shot and killed an off-duty black cop who brandished a gun as he tried to come to their aid breaking up a fight . Now questions are being raised about whether a white man would have been shot in similar circumstances . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " The- @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And movies like " The Hurricane , " about the trumped-up conviction of boxer Reuben Carter , dramatize the issue of racist treatment by police . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " The- qwq @ ( Footage-of-Fotis ; - @!Mr-JAMES-FOTIS-@1L : Sometimes if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it . And I think that 's the possibility of what 's happening . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) James Fotis runs the Law Enforcement Alliance of America . He believes that racial profiling is more of a perception , and that most cops are trying to do a tough job in the best way they can . @!Mr-FOTIS : If we put a black cloud over the heads of good police that are out there and paint police with a broad brush , that they are racist and profiling individuals , what that does is it causes other police to be very nervous and possibly not do the job that they should be doing . @!BRAVER : Do you think that all of this talk about racial profiling is intimidating to some police officers ? @!Mr-FOTIS : I think it 's very intimidating . We have to be very , very careful not to destroy the public confidence in our police . qwq @ ( Footage-of-scenes- Unidentified Officer 2 : They say Mother Nature 's the best policeman , eh ? When it gets cold , everything stops . @!BRAVER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city officials took the remarkable step last month of issuing a letter to the community , promising to end any and all forms of racial profiling , and the police union thought it was a great idea , too . Mayor DAN MALLOY ( Stamford , Connecticut ) : We 're -- we 're a community that 's relatively diverse as America goes . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Mayor Dan Malloy . Had there been complaints before that officers from Stamford were engaging in racial profiling ? Mayor MALLOY : No. @!BRAVER : No ? Mayor MALLOY : No. @!BRAVER : So then why did you even bother with it ? Mayor MALLOY : Because we know it exists , and quite frankly , we want to be ahead . Why wait till it becomes an epidemic ? Or why wait till complaints are made ? @(Footage-of-Welcome) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And Stamford is readily embracing a new state law that requires police to record the race of everyone they stop . Mayor MALLOY : If you find a police officer who has stopped , disproportionately , people of one race or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's engaging in racial profiling . That 's a reality . @(Footage-of-officer) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) So far , Connecticut is the only state that requires all local police departments to keep records of stops to prevent racial profiling . But many places across the country do it voluntarily , including most major cities in California . The Los Angeles Police Department has refused . @!Cmdr-KALISH : Just by capturing the ethnicity of the person you stop , what do you -- what does that information signify ? It can mean anything to anybody . @(Footage-of-Yagman) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Lawyer Stephen Yagman charges that LA Police Chief Bernard Parks , who is black , is just trying to avoid the truth . @!Mr-YAGMAN : One of the reasons racism is hard to prove against the LAPD is because its chief , Bernard Parks , refuses to keep records of the ethnicity of the persons who are stopped . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Parks ; - @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) The department is reassessing how it trains police to handle stops like the one Sheryl Crayton and her friends were subjected to . @!Cmdr-KALISH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals had to go through . I apologize for that . I would ask that there be some understanding in the totality of the circumstances and what the officers were confronted with . Judge WILLIS : The police do n't have a right or any business to do that to anybody . It was wrong . It was just wrong . @!Mr-PERSON : Our police are here to protect us . I 'm a serious believer in that . They should n't be here to hunt us down or pick on us because we are not like them . @(Footage-of-Crayton) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Arguments over perception , over how we see things , will not go away , and in Los Angeles and the rest of the country , to debate rages on over whether police really view crime in terms of black and white . @(Visual-of-SUNDAY-M) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Ahead on SUNDAY MORNING , from Mt .
