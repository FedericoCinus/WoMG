But improved S M technology is speeding up the search for extraM M * M terrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) , so what happens if today 's silence suddenly gives way to mm M tomorrow 's discovery ? Would the world rejoice in the news that someone 's out there ? Would euphoria engulf humanity , as Nobel Prizes are doled out like after-dinner mints ? <p> That 's one view . But many people think the discovery would be hushed up as quickly as a Mafia informant , assuming that the public could n't handle the news . Or scarier still , kept secret for fear that an unauthorized response would tell a hostile race exactly where to send their interstellar battlewagons . <p> That 's melodramatic enough . But has any serious consideration gone into what M happens when our efforts to detect cosmic intelligence pay off and we find a blip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pours into the SETI antennas ? * <p> Some think that addressing that question - even in a speculative way - is hubristic at best and wildly presumptuous at worst . After all , SETI scientists have been torquing their telescopes toward celestial targets for more than half a century without ever detecting such a signal . If we have n't won the E.T . lottery in all that time , why worry about what would happen if we got the winning ticket ? <p> Simple : SETI researchers are buying more tickets all the time , and the chances of scoring the big one keep going up . As computer power improves and new detection technology comes out of the labs , the search is accelerating . Unless the aliens are excessively secretive or simply nonexistent , we could find evidence for their presence within decades . <p> So , again , then what ? <p> Immediate reactions <p> In the spring of 1960 , astronomer Frank Drake performed the first modern SETI experiment , whimsically dubbed Project Ozma after L. Frank Baum 's fictional queen of Oz . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While pointing his antenna at the nearby Sun-like star Epsilon ( e ) Eridani , Drake heard a strong hammering signal . Surprised by how quickly his search succeeded , he wondered , " What do we do now ? <p> Drake answered his own question by rigging up additional equipment , and he soon proved that the throbbing bleats from his loudspeaker were terrestrial interference , not Eridanians trying to phone our home . <p> Project Ozma could tune to only one frequency at a time , but todays SETI receivers simultaneously monitor hundreds of millions of channels . Consequently , picking up a signal is neither remarkable nor rare : A few dozen typically come up with each scan . Naturally , no one gets very excited about this . Instead , researchers rely on sophisticated software to perform the tedious task of deciding whether these signals are likely to be alien intelligence or ( as in Drakes case ) just more human-caused radio static . <p> Only rarely does any signal survive this automatic scrutiny . But if and when that happens , a series of additional tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone at another observatory to verify the detection - to rule out equipment bugs , coding errors , or pranks . <p> The scenario for handling a signal is briefly described in a document developed under the auspices of the International Academy of Astronautics , and referred to as " SETI detection protocols . " These " best practices " boil down to this : ( 1 ) carefully verify that the signal is truly extraterrestrial , ( 2 ) inform other scientists and the public , and ( 3 ) seek international approval before transmitting any reply ( see " Abridged SETI detection protocols " on page 28 ) . <p> Not so fast <p> These are all patently good ideas that seem to suggest that everyone would handle a discovery soberly . However , such interesting signals are bound to provoke a response that 's both messy and confused because verification will take many days , at the least . <p> During all that time , word of the possible detection will surely spread via blogs and tweets from the researchers themselves ( there 's no policy of secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before any official press conference announcing that we 've found the aliens , you 'll have heard about it many times over . Indeed , you should brace yourself for plenty of future false alarms caused by signals that - at first blush - look promising . This has occurred in the past and shows the error of those who think that a discovery could be covered up . <p> Any real detection would be a headliner , everyone agrees . SETI practitioner Paul Horowitz of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , says it would " easily be the most interesting discovery in human history . Journalists would go wild , at least for a month or two . " <p> Astronomer Jill Tarter , who heads the SETI Institute 's listening efforts in Mountain View , California , concurs : " The general public will be in an excited state for a while , fueled by the media . But UFO enthusiasts will yawn because they knew it all along . " <p> A public reaction of initial enthusiasm , and not mayhem , has precedent . Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a meteorite . That story ran in The New York Times with billboard-sized headlines for three days . The public 's reaction to the possible detection of life beyond Earth ? " That 's interesting . Tell us more . " <p> The meteorite story was a stunted reprisal of astronomer Percival Lowell 's reports of martian canals a century earlier . Again , people were tantalized , but few seemed to panic . <p> Early results <p> Of course , in 1996 no one felt threatened by dead protozoans , even if they were from Mars . But SETI searches for intelligent life , and given that human beings are still the new kids on the technological block ( consider that we 've only had radio technology for a hundred years ) , you can be pretty sure that anyone we hear will be more advanced than us - possibly much more advanced . <p> That might sound unsettling , but most people do n't see it that way . A 2005 survey by the National Geographic Channel , the SETI Institute , and the University of Connecticut found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited and hopeful " to learn about a signal from E.T . Only 20 percent confessed they would be " anxious and nervous . " <p> Again , perhaps that 's not too surprising , given that any transmission we discover likely will be from beings many hundreds of light-years distant , a seemingly safe remove . And , at first , we wo n't know much more than the signal 's existence . <p> But you can bet your paycheck that every telescope on Earth will aim straight for the transmission . Is a star waiting there ? Does it have planets ? In the rush to learn more , even a stalled project like NASAs Terrestrial Planet Finder might see new life as scientists shake it out of its comatose state , infuse it with new vigor , and hurl it into orbit . <p> There are some things we could learn quickly about the signal 's source . Within a thousand light-years lie tens of millions of stars . Consequently , a few arcminutes separate them in the sky , on average . A high-resolution radio telescope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a beam size of about 5 arcseconds at the commonly used SETI frequency of 1420 megahertz . It would have little difficulty pinpointing which star hosts the detected aliens . We 'll know exactly where they live . <p> And that 's not all . Two decades ago , radio astronomers Jim Cordes and Woodruff Sullivan considered what we might learn by looking at the subtle variations of any alien signal . This includes small frequency shifts due to the Doppler effect ( which alters a signal 's frequency according to its motion ) , as well as intensity changes due to the atmosphere of E.T . ' s planet or simply its daily rotation . <p> Careful measurement could theoretically pin down the length of the aliens ' day and year , the size of their world , the presence of moons , and possibly even information about their atmosphere and magnetic field . <p> Initial questions <p> All of that would be tasty fodder for the technically inclined , but everyone else is going to ask an obvious question : What are the aliens saying ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that they 've included a message in the signal . After all , the extraterrestrials might withhold commentary if they want us to reply first , perhaps so they can gauge what level of conversation is appropriate . <p> But let 's suppose that E.T . is trying to tell us something . Just getting the message " bits " could be hard . SETI observations add up incoming static for seconds or minutes to increase the sensitivity to weak signals . This is completely analogous to astronomical photography - the longer the exposure time , the fainter the stuff you can image . <p> Unfortunately , just as a long exposure would obliterate the rapid flashes of an optical pulsar , so too would these long SETI observations smooth away any message . If , for example , the alien transmission included a television-type signal , researchers would need an antenna roughly 10,000 times larger than most of today 's radio telescopes to see the picture . Building such an enormous antenna would require impressive amounts of money and time . However , after a signal 's detection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically unlimited , unlike today 's situation . <p> In the meantime , the public would be confronted with the fact of cosmic company . We would n't know what they 're like , nor what we might learn from them , only that they exist . Anthropologist Ben Finney of the University of Hawaii at Manoa has predicted that an " interpretation industry " would quickly sprout - facile pundits who , out of conviction or merely greed , will explain to the masses what contact means and how we should feel about it . <p> And in particular , how should religions react ? Research in this area is lacking , but most mainstream theologians have expressed the upbeat view that our belief systems could adapt . As Vatican Observatory astronomer Brother Guy Consolmagno has said , " If your religion has survived millennia - if it can handle Copernicus , Galileo , and even Darwin - then E.T . should eventually prove palatable . " <p> Mainstream religion might easily incorporate the discovery , but fundamentalists will have a harder time . They are less willing to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And unless you 're inclined to consider seraphim , nephilim , or angels as alien beings , most religions do n't anticipate the presence of intelligent life on other worlds ( an exception is Mormonism ) . <p> The fundamentalists would likely rail against the discovery , claiming it 's " just Satan , tempting you , " according to sociologist Bill Bainbridge of George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia . <p> Significance sets in <p> Without doubt , learning of other beings among the star fields of the Milky Way would be discomfiting to some . But the most profound consequences of a SETI detection would surely be the long-term impacts . And these would affect everyone . <p> The degree to which a signal would alter the lives of our descendants depends on whether we could decode any attached message . This might sound like a tractable problem - merely a matter of time and effort . After all , humans eventually deciphered hieroglyphics , Linear B , and other " messages " that once seemed as inscrutable as teenage behavior . But the universe is old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomprehensible to our 3-pound hominid brains . <p> Still , lets take the sunny view and assume that we eventually learn what the aliens are saying . Because , as noted , they 're likely to be well in advance of us , the information might include such practical topics as all of physics and astronomy , the extent and nature of cosmic biology and intelligence , the whether and how of faster-than-light travel , and many other things that are the provenance of science fiction today . To suddenly learn such matters would trigger a sharp discontinuity in our species ' history - a kind of " wormhole " to a future that we might otherwise reach only after thousands or millions of years . <p> Aside from such a torrent of knowledge , we would confront the fact that the differences among humans are of trivial import compared to the gulf between extraterrestrials and ourselves . Some people , such as SETI 's Tarter , suggest that this would lead to more human harmony and less worry that we 're on the road to destruction . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , too . <p> Sociologist Don Tarter of the University of Alabama , Huntsville , is less sanguine . He notes that the idea of the world 's peoples coming together in sweetness and light - popular in the early days of space exploration with the first pictures of Earth as a small blue orb against a vast , dark sky - was shattered by subsequent wars and terrorist attacks . We 're back to the usual conflict and competition . <p> And what about a response ? If we know where the aliens live , do we dare reply with our own shout out ? Or would that , as some aver , merely expose our planet to possible future destruction because we 've given away our existence and position ? <p> In fact , while no one can say whether aliens would be peaceable or pugnacious , we 've been sending radio , television , and ( most visibly ) radar signals into space inadvertently for more than 90 years . Any society that has the capability to travel interstellar distances and threaten our world could easily pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using their own sun as a gravitational lens , the nearest could theoretically see the lights from our cities . Any deliberate reply from us would simply add to information they already have . <p> The great unknown <p> Frankly , predicting the truly durable consequences of a SETI success is a fool 's errand . Consider if members of the Spanish court in 1492 had written a treatise on what the discovery of a new continent might eventually mean . An interesting exercise , but not one likely to have much currency a few hundred years down the road . <p> But this much we can say : If SETI succeeds , we 'll have proof that biology is as much a part of the cosmos as pulsars and pockmarked planets . And , while instant brotherhood is unlikely to erupt suddenly on Earth , we 'll at least know we 're neither the crown of creation nor even particularly exceptional . For as long as our species exists , we 'll be aware that we 're just one more duck in a row . <p> And you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The search for extraterrestrial intelligence <p> ( SETI ) may not have found anything yet , but it 's important'to plan a response , says SETI expert Seth Shostak - likely the first person to know when the search succeeds .

I love being out in winter , but how do I pitch a tent in snow , and what should I expect from my gear when temperatures dip below 2O0F ? " <p> EXPERT R.L Stolz , Alpine Adventures , Adirondack mountain guides <p> * Solution " Stay warm by picking the right spot to pitch your tent and making sure your gear is up for the conditions . Make your first-ever winter trips late in the season , when temperatures are typically milder and days are getting longer . The margin for error is larger . " <p> Pitch a Bomber Tent <p> Erect a shelter correctly-in the right spot , and secure against the worst weather . <p> * Pick a safe , warm site . Choose campsites away from cliff edges , avalanche slopes , and dead branches or trees ( called widowmakers ) . Try to set up away from wind and low spots , where cold air settles . Determine if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating the alpha angle , the angle between the top of a potential avalanche slope and your campsite . If the alpha angle is more than 20 degrees ( see below left ) , do n't set up camp in that area . <p> * Pack the surface . While wearing skis or snowshoes , stomp out a platform about twice as large as your tent . Wait 30 minutes to one hour for the packed snow to harden ( called sintering ) enough to walk on . While you wait , dig out table surfaces for a cooking area , and pack down routes to a toilet and a water source . <p> * Stake it out . Use snow stakes ( or improvise with rocks , sticks , snow-filled stuffsacks , or skis- anything that you wo n't need to use while the tent is pitched ) to secure tent comers and guyllnes . To set anchors : Pack a one-foot-deep hole in the snow where you want to place the stake and ( ay the anchor in the base of It . Fill the hole with snow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle and harden . <p> * Protect against wind . Pitch your shelter 's most aerodynamic end facing the wind . Tents are most wind-resistant when pitched tightly , so stake it securely and use a sliding knot like a trucker 's hitch ( see below right ) so you can retighten lines without having to reset anchors . If possible , position the door at a 90-degree angle to the wind to minimize access-blocking snowdrifts . Consider pitching behind a natural windbreak like a dense stand of trees , or building a wall of snow on the tent 's windward side . If your wall is three feet tall , build it three feet from your tent so drifts it collects do n't bury your shelter . <p> Sleep Warm <p> REST WELL TO WEATHER COLD DAVS . <p> * Stay dry .

##4110559 Iconic scenery bolstered by serious solitude ? Get them both on this weekiong traverse . By Colleen Contrisciane-Lewis <p> Day 1 <p> Naturally , Rowan and I want quality time alone-we eloped just weeks before our hike , and this Continental Divide-crossing route will not only be my Reader Leader dream trip , but also our honeymoon . And judging from the deserted parking lot at the Chief Mountain entry near the Canadian border , we are off to a good start . The rewards come quickly on the Pacific Northwest Trail . Just two miles in , we pop through the trees for our first blown-open view of Glacier 's jagged peaks : Sentinel and Bear Mountains , both well over 8,000 feet , with a golden meadow sprawling below , framed with an explosion of purple lupine , beargrass , and fireweed . We are mesmerized . <p> At mile seven , we take a 300-yard side trail to Gros Ventre Falls , a 30-foot cascade spilling into a turquoise pool before coursing down another drop . Rowan ca n't resist a swim in " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenns Lake Camp at mile 10.5 , next to sky blue waters beneath Cosley Ridge 3,000 feet above . We meet a couple camped nearby who are keenly interested in Rowan 's accent-he 's from Zimbabwe . They recognize it as the same unique accent spoken by their farrier , back home in Indiana . Like many African countries , Zimbabwe has experienced devastating famine and civil unrest in recent decades , which led to a massive diaspora . So while it 's preposterous to think Rowan would know the couple 's farrier , just because they both speak with a Zimbabwean accent , they ca n't help asking . More shocking than seeing a grizzly : The man was one of Rowan 's best friends in high school , but they lost touch In the chaos . This reconnection in the Glacier wilderness seems all but impossible , but serendipitous experiences like this have trained me to embrace interactions with people In the wild , rather than feel overly protective of my solitude . ( Rowan has since made contact with his lost friend . ) <p> Day 2 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cosley Ridge and Pyramid Peak . As we begin climbing Stoney Indian , - it seems that every 100 feet of elevation gain grants us another mile of sky to see , another lake , waterfall , or row of peaks to appreciate . It 's immediately obvious why Stoney Indian campsite is so sought after : It 's prime real estate , offering a lake and a waterfall , an amazing westerly view , and an open-air privy . <p> Day 3 <p> When I backpack solo , I can do breakfast and pack in 30 minutes . With Rowan , It takes two hours , and my frustration is building to a boil . He has some serious backcountry skill-he worked as a safari guide the past 20 years , But he 's had porters take care of food , organizing , packing , and hauling gear- a backpacker 's essential crafts . This is his first real DIY trek . <p> We leave camp at 10 a.m. on trail thick with white , confettilike cow parsnip- neck high at times and heavy from last night 's rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turn and head north toward Goat Haunt . My spirits warm with the day and shoot sky-high when we arrive at our next campsite at Lake Francis , , a tealpool beneath thousand-foot cliffs . From the beach , we see runoff from Dixon Glacier plunging hundreds of feet into the lake and peaks turning peach In the setting sun . <p> Day 4 <p> The next morning , I do n't fuss about an early start . The magic of Lake Francis - and Rowan 's **30;905;TOOLONG approach- is seeping in , and I find myself losing track of time while photographing reflections In the water . <p> We climb up Brown 's Pass , a 6,255-foot saddle , enjoying Thunderbird Falls as a navigational handrail along the way . When we crest the top , we negotiate a graveyard of pines snapped like matchsticks . Most of the trees broke at their bases during a late-season avalanche , and snow still obscures the trail <p> Once we find the path , we lengthen our trekking poles and begin a steep and loose descent to Bowman Lake at mite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peabody and Carter . <p> Day 5 <p> This morning , we take it slow purposefully . It 's our honeymoon , and the seven-mile stretch of trail along Bowman Lake is flat , fast , and breathtaking . The park 's topography changes quite a bit on the west side of the Continental Divide , and when we leave the Pacific Northwest Trail and turn down Lower Quartz Trail at mile ..... 51 we begin to notice the differences . The trees grow thicker and taller , and the mountains are rounder and gentler than the sharp peaks east of the divide . Another difference : We do n't see a soul , and our campsite at calm and piney Lower Quartz Lake is deserted . <p> We arrive at camp early , and talk about packing fishing rods the next time , so we can cook a trout dinner . Or maybe even horsepacking one day . Less than an hour later , a couple on horses appears . The husband jumps off his horse and says , " Do you like fish ? I 've heard this lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish at our feet , the couple rides away to leave us to a private feast . Does the trail magic ever stop ? <p> Day 6 <p> As we hike from Lower Quartz Lake to the Inside North Fork Road crossing at mile 60.7 , the sense of being utterly alone becomes palpable . We never see so much as a fresh footprint . We linger by crystal-clear Lower Quartz Creek and have a languid swim in its shallow ( and ' warm ) waters . " <p> After crossing the road , we continue south to Logging Lake Trail . " Would you mind silencing your bear bell ? " Rowan asks . " The incessant jingle Is grating . And I 'd love to see a bear . " <p> Who am I to argue with a man who 's lived with lions ? So , against my better judgment , I silence my bell , and zip my lips . We hike 30 minutes before seeing a grizzly 20 yards off the trail . It behaves like every other bear I 've ever encountered and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think thditors of BACKPACKER would like " their readers to have such a juicy detail . But the bear only runs a short distance before stopping to stand on its hind legs and get a better view of Rowan . I make some noise , and the bear takes off again .

##4110567 Seven lucky-to-be-alive subscribers share their real-life backcountry disasters . Here 's how they survived , and what you can learn from their mistakes . As told to Kristy Holland <p> Caught in a Flash Flood <p> Survivor Sarah Owen , 33 , Page , Arizona <p> Predicament Trapped by rising water and quicksand in Paria Canyon , Utah <p> Lesson learned " Gambling with the weather never pays off , even when you think you have great odds . " <p> I could go no higher , so I braced myself in a tiny cave , horrified , as the surge of water approached . The flood changed color in an instant , from gray to burnt orange . The force of the flood increased , and a wave of debris rounded the upstream bend , out-roaring the already deafening downpour . The water rushed by just three feet below my perch ; there was nothing I could do If It kept rising . <p> Earlier that day , when I discussed my plans for a three-day solo trip down the Parla River toward Lees Ferry with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely more than a trickle , she told me , but monsoon rains had swollen the river 's flow . It would be passable , but I should expect the water to be higher than normal , and I 'd have to be on alert for flooding . The forecast called for a 20-percent chance of rain- so I decided to go for It . <p> I started in a broad , brushy valley , and the trail let me avoid the knee-deep river and shoreline quicksand for the first four miles . Then the steep sandstone walls converged at the narrows . In the slot ahead , I 'd be getting wet . The river spanned the canyon 's width with only occasional sandy beaches . <p> Forging ahead , I checked that there was blue overhead . There was , but I could only see a sliver of the sky- I did n't realize there were ominous clouds above the plateaus nearby . Within 40 minutes , It started raining . I Immediately scanned the canyon walls for a high ledge and spied a three-foot-high cave that would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time I climbed Into It , the downpour was torrential and waterfalls spouted off the towering cliffs all around me . <p> The churning water carried full-size logs and seethed for more than an hour , cresting just a few feet below my cave . But instead of a wall of water that came and went quickly , the 30-foot-wide frothing flow took hours to recede . I knew that rain upstream in the drainage would mean more flooding here , so when the water level subsided , I decided to retreat from the narrows , back the way I had come . <p> I 'd passed a high-ground campsite about 1.5 miles upstream from my cave , but as I backtracked through the canyon , I sank Into quicksand . A thick slurry of water and sand clutched at my thighs , hips , and rib cage . Instead of staying calm , I flailed In the muck . When I finally realized that going forward meant thrashing through a gauntlet of sucking mud , I crawled out and retreated downstream to a ledge above the soupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water recede . <p> I slept fitfully , watching the river 's mood change throughout the night It must have rained somewhere In the drainage because I heard the thundering approach of another surge crashing between the canyon walls . <p> A few hours after daybreak , a pair of backpackers rounded my campsite . They 'd camped in a different gulch downstream and were trekking toward the trailhead where I 'd started . They had n't yet encountered the quicksand I 'd seen upstream , and they were dismayed when I described the flooding and conditions I 'd encountered . I joined them for my retreat out of the Parla . It was slow going , as quicksand sucked at our legs , but thankfully , we made it back together . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Find High Ground <p> You did everything right- checked the forecast , hiked during the dry season- but a freak storm caught you anyway , and the canyon is quickly filling with water . How high do you need to go ? " It depends on the geology of the canyon , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have higher , faster flows than wide , vegetated valleys . " His advice : Look for the debris line of sticks and logs left behind by previous floods and climb above It Ca n't find high enough ground ? As a last-ditch effort , get behind a boulder or rock fin that will reduce the force of the water . <p> Stay Afloat in Quicksand <p> * Do n't struggle . Moving water ( and panicked . Jerking movement ) reduces friction between Individual grains of sand , which lowers surface stability and will cause you to sink . <p> * Distribute your weight . Remove your pack and gently release your arms and legs from the sand as you crawl ontp its surface . Then , flip onto your back Into a spreadeagle position . <p> * Swim . Backstroke toward safety- higher ground , riverbanks , or sandy surfaces with rocks or plants on them , which indicate a more stable surface . <p> Uncontrolled Slide Down an Icy Slope <p> Survivor Ron Whlttaker , 50 , Boise , Idaho <p> Predicament Careening down a summer snowf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lesson learned " Respect mountain conditions in every season . If you 're facing steep , slick terrain , bring crampons and an ice axe- or turn around . " <p> My rate of acceleration was so shocking that I could barely react . I was hurtling down a snowy slope at frightening speeds . I managed to flip onto my stomach and get my trekking pole Into a self-arrest position , but the icy slope jerked it out of my hands , and I slid out of control toward a minefield of rocks . <p> I 'd set out on that sunny July day with two buddies , Jerry and Tyler , to hike a 10-mlle stretch of the Idaho Centennial Trail . The unusually deep snowpack was definitely a surprise . This typically was n't a technical or dangerous area so we had n't packed crampons or even microsplkes for our hiking shoes , but even near the hike 's beginning we encountered IQ-foot-deep snowfields in our path . <p> At about 3 p.m. , we set out across a packed , 200-yard-wide drift clinging stubbornly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope without incident , driving his boots into the hard snow . Tyler almost made it all the way across , but near the snowfield 's edge he slipped , careening J5 feet downhill before digging his feet into the icy surface to stop himself . I followed Tyler 's footsteps until , just a few steps from the edge , I lifted my foot and my trekking pole simultaneously ; I was down and sliding before I knew it . My pole ricocheted out of my grip , and 1 could n't get any purchase with my hands and feet . I was hurtling faster and faster toward certain death in the boulders below . <p> Jerry , who was on solid ground , grabbed onto a tree and then for me as I slid past him . He clutched at my shirt , but his effort only shifted my momentum , slowing me slightly and twisting me toward the edge of the snowfield . As I tobogganed past a half-buried tree , I grabbed a branch and swung to a halt- just seconds above the field 's rocky base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full speed , this would n't be a survival story at all . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Cross Summer Snow <p> * Check slope runout . Snow is n't avy-prone on compacted summer slopes , so when judging chute safety , your potential sliding path should be your primary concern . Avoid traversing above long , steep , or dangerous runouts when hiking without crampons , an ice axe , or rope . <p> * Find quality snow . Summer snowpack is often very hard , tough to dig steps Into . Look above and below the trail for softer snow . Tip : Beware areas near trees , streams , and rocks , which absorb heat and create dangerous holes . <p> * Kick steps . " Look for existing flats you can enhance , " suggests American Alpine Institute guide Kurt Hicks . For perfect steps , he suggests hitting the snow with the toe edge of your shoe in a slicing motion . Angle your foot so the platform is level , and continue kicking until it is wide enough to support more than half of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put most of your weight on your forefoot , and maintain upright posture , which helps keep your shoe in contact with the snow . " Even if steps exist , " says Hicks , " you 'll have better traction if you kick into them . " <p> Charged by a 500-Pound Grizzly <p> Survivor Adam Shinn , 31 , Boulder , Colorado <p> Predicament Close-range encounter in Yellowstone National Park , Wyoming <p> Lesson learned " In bruin country , everyone should pack- and know how to use- a canister of bear spray . " <p> Three of us hiked eight miles into the Lamar . Valley for a springtime fishing extravaganza on Pebble Creek . When it was time to hike home , we spoke loudly as we traversed bear country- open meadows and thick forests . Three miles from camp , we cruised into a field of tall grass and flowers- and spotted a full-grown grizzly . <p> We froze . Speaking directly to the bear in calm voices , we backed away slowly . But he charged anyway , huffing and grunting as he ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready with bear spray , and I squeezed the trigger , emptying my canister , as my companions dropped to the ground . <p> The spray stopped him , but only briefly . He made another run toward us from just 30 feet away . A cloud of deterrent hung in the air ; when he hit it , he turned , and sprinted into the forest . Thankfully we did n't encounter another bear- without more spray we would have been easy targets for an attack . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Use Bear Spray Safely <p> " If an animal comes within 50 feet , use your spray , " recommends Dave Parker , a certified * bear spray safety trainer . If the bear is n't running , point the nozzle about 30 feet away , and fire a series of one- to two-second bursts . If it 's charging , point the spray at the bear 's chest and hold the trigger until the can is fully discharged . Out of spray and the grizzly is still charging ? Do n't run , lay on your stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flipped , Soaked , and Freezing <p> Survivors Matt and Agnes Hage , 38 and 29 , Anchorage , Alaska <p> Predicament Hypothermic after a dip into icy Whitewater near Girdwood , Alaska <p> Lesson learned " If things do n't seem right , bail early . The compounding effects of bad decisions can kill people in the wilderness . " <p> In moderate conditions , the Twentymile River is a straightforward , beginner-level packraft trip with only a few rippling corners near the put-in . We were going on a mild July weekend with nighttime temps forecast to stay in the high 40s , and noaa.gov 's river gauge reported that the flow was mellow . Things looked perfect for our inaugural 15-mile float down the glacier-fed waterway . <p> The first few bends were supposed to be the crux of our trip . We hesitated because the water looked more aggressive than we 'd expected , but we proceeded anyway , thinking these waves would be the day 's biggest thrill . What we did n't know was that in the 24 hours since we 'd checked the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within minutes , Agnes hit a sweeper and her packraft flipped her into the 440F water . By the time we regrouped on the river 's far side , she was shivering and had lost her paddle- an essential piece of gear for ferrying her boat across the rapids . <p> We could n't cross the river back toward the trailhead without a major bushwhack , so we plodded through the shallows toward the flat lower valley . It was n't until evening , after we 'd spent the day knee-deep in the frigid water , that we realized the river was flooded and impassable . Our lips and skin were blue , our fingers and toes were numb , and we were shaking violently . Hypothermia was setting in , and we realized we 'd be stuck overnight . <p> At that point , we knew we were in trouble , and we focused on getting out of the water . It took two more hours of panicked bushwhacking and waist-deep wading to do it . We finally found a spot on a hillside to build a fire . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry clothes ( thankfully , we each carried a drybag with a wool baselayer ) warmed us enough to allow blood to flow back into our extremities . We even rested a bit before the all-day bushwhack to get home . Now , when in doubt , we turn back . There 's always a next time . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Treat Hypothermia <p> * Mild Change into dry , insulating layers and do light exercises , like jumping jacks or sit-ups . Eat and drink ; warm foods ( such as steaming soups or hot chocolate ) are better , but even cold meals and liquids will boost metabolism and add calories , raising your body temperature . Apply external heat like a hot-water-filled bottle to the chest or armpits . Insulate bare skin from direct heat . <p> * Severe If the victim stops shivering due to energy loss , treat the situation as a life-or-death emergency .

If my partner had n't been prepared with a bailout plan , I could have died . " <p> I was fit after a winter of skiing , so when the snowpack was still solid in April , my friend Tim and I planned a light-and-fast ski traverse of the San Juan Mountains . Conditions were tough , and two 12-hour days wiped me out . I was tired and developed a cough from the all-day efforts in the dry mountain air- or so I thought . <p> On our second night , we set up camp near 11,000 feet , above the headwaters of the east fork of Colorado 's Piedra River , and I went straight to bed . At 11 p.m. , a low rumbling noise woke me up from a restless sleep . I listened for it again and realized that it was n't an animal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called out to Tim : " We need to get down , now . I think I have high-altitude pulmonary edema HAPE . " By 1 a.m. , we were dropping through the drainage en route to help , and descending to reduce my symptoms . <p> Tim had researched potential evacuation points before the trip , and we were headed toward a lodge lower in the basin . But by noon , my condition had worsened and we 'd only gone down a few thousand feet . I had slowed to a crawl , and was coughing up fluid with every exhale . We split up so I could rest while Tim raced for help . My breathing worsened throughout the night , but I surprised myself with my sense of clarity . I was grateful for being In the wilderness . <p> When the chopper touched down the next morning , I was barely moving , but after oxygen therapy and a few days in the hospital , I was on the road to recovery . I 'm healthy now , but I have a heightened awareness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Recognize HAPE <p> Only half of high altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ) victims show early signs of altitude sickness , so its onset might come as a surprise . Symptoms usually appear on the second night at altitude so be on alert , and descend immediately to stop them . <p> * Early signs Dry cough , reduced performance , shortness of breath ( while moving and at rest ) <p> * Later symptoms Gurgling noises when breathing , cough that produces phlegm ( frothy sputum is often bloody and pink ) , chest pain , and increased heart rate and respiration <p> Struck by Lightning <p> Survivor Stan Feil , 46 , Visalia , California <p> Predicament Caught In an electrical storm on the exposed summit of a 14,000-foot peak , Colorado <p> Lesson learned " Follow your instincts about reducing risk exposure , even if other people disagree with you . Your life depends on good judgment . " <p> An arc of electricity jumped out of the ground and flowed directly into my left hand . It looked like something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway between the summit of Colorado 's highest mountain ( 14,440-foot Mt . Elbert ) and treeline when I was hit . By then I 'd already been running full-bore down the mountain for almost 20 minutes . <p> We 'd waited longer than we should have at the summit , hoping that all 15 of the people in our group would make it to the top . Summit fever was high , as the peak would be the fifth Fourteener of the week for most of the Boy Scouts in the troop . I Joined the group , which Included my teenage son , lust the day before this hike . There had been rain , but no highcountry lightning all week . So when I mentioned the building clouds , the boys and troop leaders were n't overly concerned . I should have acted on my instincts to get off the summit right then . 1 was the only one who seemed worried about the storm until one of the boys , a 15-year-old with shoulder-length locks , pointed to his hairliterally standing on end because of the static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The charge in the air was palpable and we should have dropped to the ground , but fear took over . We started running and I hoped that my legs and knees could handle the pounding pace . I yelled to the boys to spread out as they ran- not to group together- knowing that they 'd reach treeline long before I would . <p> Within minutes . It was pouring rain . Lightning and thunder boomed and flashed simultaneously . It was like a battlefield , with jagged bolts hitting the ground every 10 to 15 seconds like bombs . Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! <p> I was praying as I ran , and when I saw the bolt of electricity jump from the ground to my fingers , I thought I was a goner . My hand was hot and my arm was tingling from the shock , but surprisingly , 1 was otherwise uninjured . The pounding in my heart , lungs , and legs was from the running- not the direct hit I 'd narrowly avoided . It 's the only time in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire life did n't flash before my eyes , but I worried about my wife and family , and when it was over I felt lucky to be alive and humbled by nature . <p> ESCAPE PLAN <p> Reduce the Risk of a Strike <p> The forecast did n't warn of lightning within 100 miles of your hike- but that crack was unmistakable and clouds are rolling In . Now what ? <p> Lightning can strike ground more than 25 miles from storm clouds , so blue sky overhead does n't mean you 're safe . In fact , there 's no place In the backcountry that Is completely safe in an electrical storm , but your first move should be to seek safer terrain . Move off of peaks and ridges , and to the lowest ground nearby . In rolling landscapes , drop into a depression , like a dry ravine .
