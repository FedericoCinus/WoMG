While they share the screen relatively briefly in their new motion picture , Rita Braver tells us they 've been sharing their lives for a whole lot longer . @(Photo-of-Amy-Madig) @!Ms-AMY-MADIGAN : We 've been married 17 years . @!RITA-BRAVER-report : That 's a long time by anybody 's standards . @!Ms-MADIGAN : I guess it is , is n't it , you know ? @!Mr-ED-HARRIS : Plus , we 've worked at it , you know ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : Yeah , we ... @!BRAVER : You have ? @!Mr-HARRIS : Oh , yeah . @!Ms-MADIGAN : Oh , yeah . @!BRAVER : In what way ? @!Mr-HARRIS : Well , she kind of said , ' You got to talk about a few things , Ed , you know ? ' @!BRAVER : Yeah . @!Mr-HARRIS : You know -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BRAVER : And you 've gotten better ? @!Mr-HARRIS : Yeah , a little bit . @!Ms-MADIGAN : We 're kind of doing both . @(Footage-of-couple) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) Ed Harris and Amy Madigan are living proof of the old adage that opposites attract . She 's outgoing , with a giggle that wo n't quit . @!Ms-MADIGAN : Yeah , right -- something like that . @(Footage-of-couple) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) He 's more introspective , and coaxing a laugh out of him can take some work . But they share an unwavering commitment to each other . @!Mr-HARRIS : She 's really intelligent . You know , I think she 's a beautiful woman , person . And , well , you know , she 's my partner , you know ? qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) That partnership is on display in " Pollock , " Harris ' new film about artist Jackson Pollock . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) Harris produced , starred and made his directing debut in the new film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guggenheim , Pollock 's cranky art patron . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) But she did n't get the bigger part of Pollock 's wife , artist Lee Krasner . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : Were you disappointed that you did n't get that role ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : No . If I was casting the film , I would not cast Amy for that part . I do n't think I 'm the right person for it . I -- I really do mean it was not a disappointment for me because it was really more about Ed get -- getting the film the way that he wanted it to be . qwq @ ( Footage-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) In fact , making this film became an obsession for Harris . It started back in 1986 , when his father sent him a book about Pollock and pointed out the striking physical resemblance between the artist and the actor . Harris became fascinated by the hard-drinking , volatile and sometimes violent king of American abstract expressionism. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce , direct and act in this movie ? @!Mr-HARRIS : You know , I worked on it most of the ' 90s , spent a lot of time with the script . @(Footage-of-Harris-) @!Mr-HARRIS : ( Voiceover ) I had a lot of feeling about it . I did n't know if I would have been hard-pressed to tell you what my vision was in particular , but I knew that I ha -- I had a -- very specific personal feelings about this and I did n't want to just hand it over to someone else and let them -- and follow their guidance , you know ? @(Photo-of-Pollock) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) By then , Harris had realized that he and Pollock shared more than physical qualities . @!Mr-HARRIS : A deep kind of insecurity on some level , a desire to -- to do one 's best , an ultimate confidence in one 's ability , a need for approval . @!BRAVER : Do you feel like you 've ever struggled with the same kinds of inner demons that he struggled with ? @!Mr-HARRIS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I mean , I think probably most people walking on the planet have at one point or another -- particularly creative people . You know , I 've had periods of time , but never -- never so dark , never so black that I di -- could n't see my way out of it , you know ? @!Mr-JACKSON-POLLOCK : ( From vintage video ) I do n't work from drawings or color sketches . @(Footage-of-vintage) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) Harris was determined that the film be authentic . He studied these famous scenes of Pollock ... @!Mr-POLLOCK : ( From vintage video ) This way I can walk around it , work from all four sides and be in the painting . qwq @ ( Footage-of- " Polloc @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) ... and even took up painting himself in order to recreate the artist 's sense of passionate abandon . qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!Mr-HARRIS : And that was the most freeing time for me , really , in the whole process , was when I got to paint , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , whether it works or not is not even the point . So I pretty much just painted , and then they filmed me. qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " Poll @!BRAVER : What was it like working and living with your husband when he was playing the role of Jackson Pollock , this kind of really intense genius , who was also apparently somewhat manic-depressive ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : Well , I did n't see Ed a lot , which probably was the saving grace for the whole family , you know ? I like working with Ed , and he had a lot of hats to wear on this one and he was certainly kind of frayed at some points . But I think if you 're intimate with somebody , it 's a good idea if you work with them or it 's a really bad idea . I do n't think there 's lots of shades of gray . And it seems to work out pretty well for Ed and I. @(Photo-of-couple) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) The two have worked together frequently over the years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Places in the Heart . " It was during the filming of that one that they got married . qwq @ ( Footage-of- " Places @!Mr-HARRIS : We had talked about it on Friday or something . @!Ms-MADIGAN : Yeah . @!Mr-HARRIS : We had made a decision we were going to get married on Monday and of course we had the weekend to think about it , you know , but we had talked about it earlier than that . But I remember ... @!Ms-MADIGAN : Yeah . @!Mr-HARRIS : ... waking up Monday morning going , ' Oh . ' You know , I was -- I said -- Amy said , ' We do n't have to get married today -- today if you do n't want to . ' @!Ms-MADIGAN : Yeah , I did . @!Mr-HARRIS : And I said , ' Let 's go have some breakfast , ' you know ? So we had a little breakfast in this little coffee shop and a little cup of coffee and a cigarette , felt a little better . And then we went down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Ms-MADIGAN : And he turned b -- he -- he turned white , absolutely white . @!Mr-HARRIS : Yeah , it was surreal. @!Ms-MADIGAN : And he had to put his head between his legs and then he was OK. @!BRAVER : Is that true ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : I swear to God . @!Mr-HARRIS : I almost fainted , yeah . @!BRAVER : Is this true ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : Why -- why would we make that up ? I mean , I c ... @(Footage-of-couple) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) In addition to their work together , they have each been successful independently . Madigan played Kevin Costner 's skeptical but loyal wife in " Field of Dreams .

" qwq @ ( Excerpt-from- " The- Unidentified Reporter : A lot -- a lot of people suggest that -- that the nomination really , to a large degree , is the winner . Do you -- do you agree with that ? @!Mr-HARRIS : No. qwq @ ( Footage-of-Harris ; @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) Now Harris is a dark horse contender for a nomination as a leading actor for his portrayal of Jackson Pollock , an honor that could take his career to a whole new level . One of the things that 's said is that maybe this will mean that you do more leading roles in big movies ... @!Mr-HARRIS : Yeah . @!BRAVER : ... and not so many supporting roles , as great as they 've been . @!Mr-HARRIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons I wanted to do the film in the first place was because I 'm an actor and I wanted to play the main guy , you know , and have it -- make a film that was about my character . Now here again , I 've invested -- I 've invested so much of my own money in " Pollock " that I 've -- I have got to work , and so I 'm doing a lot of jobs that are supporting parts , you know ? And so it 's , like , ' Well , maybe I broke through , but now I 'm breaking back through the other way . ' We 'll see . @!BRAVER : You know , there have to be times when one of you has a great part and maybe the other does n't have anything going at the same time . Is that hard ? @!Ms-MADIGAN : Sometimes fo -- fo -- in my situation , it 's hard just because I 'd like to work more and my opportunities are -- are n -- kind of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive of ea -- each other 's choices and -- and what we 're able to do .

Not anymore . I mean , the first -- I think the first year or two , there was a little bit of that in me , at least , you know , but it did n't last too long ... @!Ms-MADIGAN : No. @!Mr-HARRIS : ... you know ? @(Photo-of-couple) @!BRAVER : ( Voiceover ) Harris , Madigan , both age 50 and their seven-year-old daughter -- they did n't want her photographed -- seem to have a remarkably well-adjusted life , especially -- let 's face it -- for two movie stars .

##54363 CHARLES @!OSGOOD , host : February is Black History Month , a good time to take note of an overlooked chapter of American black heritage involving a woman you see on this postage stamp . Randall Pinkston has the tale of a remarkable entrepreneur who began in the humblest of circumstances in the South before moving on to the grandest settings in the North . @(Footage-of-Hudson-) @!RANDALL-PINKSTON-r : @(Voiceover) Here in the Hudson River Valley , the captains of American industry built their mansions : John D. Rockefeller , Andrew Carnegie and financier Jay Gould . And so did Madam C.J. Walker , a little-known African-American who became one of the richest , most successful businesswomen in the nation almost 100 years ago . Let other mansions hide behind shrubs and fences . Madam Walker built her home right on the road , where everyone could see what she had accomplished . @(Photograph-of-Mada) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) And what she had accomplished was nothing short of remarkable . @(Photograph-of-cabi) @!Ms-A'LELIA-BUNDLES : She was born Sarah Breedlove on a plantation in Delta , Louisiana , where her parents had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep South , with no formal education but lots of business savvy , Madam C.J. Walker built a financial empire , selling African-American hair-care products door to door . @(Photograph-of-Wond) @!Ms-BUNDLES : @(Voiceover) This was her first product . Her first two products were Vegetable Shampoo and Wonderful Hair Grower . @(Footage-of-Pinksto) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) A'Lelia Bundles is the great-great granddaughter of Madam Walker and the other of a book about her , " On Her Own Ground . " @!Ms-BUNDLES : Madam Walker was very smart about marketing . She used her own image on her products , and sh -- that allowed other women to identify with not only her products , with -- but with her success . @(Footage-of-Vegetab) @!Ms-BUNDLES : So the idea of hope in a jar , which is a centuries-old way of selling products , was something that she employed . @!PINKSTON : And now this was her first picture . @(Photographs-of-Wal) @!Ms-BUNDLES : This is the -- the oldest picture that I know of her , and I think it was probably taken in the 1890s , and you can ... @!PINKSTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.50 a week as a laundry woman . One decade later , her company was making $ 1,000 a day . How did she do it ? As the story goes , she invented Wonderful Hair Grower to treat her own bald spots . @(Footage-of-Bundles) @!Ms-BUNDLES : She said she was so embarrassed by her appearance , that she prayed to God for a solution . And then she said three nights in a row , a big black man came to her in a dream and told her what to mix up for her hair . @(Footage-of-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) Long before Avon or Mary Kay cosmetics , Madam Walker was training thousands of African-American women to sell her products door to door . @!Ms-BUNDLES : Oh , I love this . This is a -- a badge that the Walker agents wore at their national conventions . @(Photograph-of-peop) @!Mr-STANLEY-NELSON- : Before Madam Walker , for black women , there were really two choices , you know , f -- in -- in -- for professions . A black woman could b -- be a maid , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolteacher , if she was lucky , in a black school . That was about it .

In the mid- ' 80s for his documentary " Two Dollars and a Dream , " Nelson interviewed some of the women who had worked for Madam Walker . Unidentified Woman 1 : Her mannerisms got me . I knew she was a great woman , and we looked upon her as a great woman . Unidentified Woman 2 : I think that -- that Madam Walker made that great discovery and that she was doing so much to help our people and to help our women to look beautiful , and you know all women like to look beautiful and always look well groomed . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) The factory in Indianapolis was national headquarters of the Walker Company , but it was more than that . It was a symbol , just as she was . @(Footage-of-Walker-) @!Ms-BUNDLES : @(Voiceover) One -- one of the things that the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of their products but the success of African-Americans. @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) As Madam Walker grew wealthy and famous , the lavish lifestyle she and her daughter enjoyed became legendary , even notorious . Some felt her mansion , Villa Lewaro , was over the top . @!Ms-BUNDLES : There were people who criticized her , who said , ' Why are you spending all of this money ? ' and , ' This is conspicuous consumption . ' And she countered that by telling them , ' I am building this home so that I can show young black boys and girls all of their possibilities . ' This house was built , as she said , with Negro money . She was using her money symbolically . @(Footage-of-Pinksto) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) But she also used her money to help others and to fight the injustices of a segregated America . @!Ms-BUNDLES : @(Voiceover) Her first large contribution was a gift of $ 1,000 to the black YMCA in Indianapolis . And that made headlines in black newspapers all across the country , because it was the largest gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , like , $ 25,000 today . In 1919 , just before she died , she contributed $ 5,000 to the NAACP 's anti-lynching fund . It was the largest gift the NAACP had ever received and amounted to about a -- a tenth of their budget . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) One of A'Lelia Bundle 's favorite stories is about Madam Walker 's persistence in getting the attention of Booker T. Washington . The most influential black leader of his day , Washington had ignored her at a 1912 business conference . @!Ms-BUNDLES : She waited for the final banker to make his remarks , stood at her seat , looked toward Booker T. Washington and said , ' Surely , you 're not going to shut the door in my face . I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South . From there I was promoted to the washtub , and from there , I promoted myself . I have built my own factory on my own ground .

Unidentified Woman 3 : Oh , yes . @(Footage-of-Bundles) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) For years , A'Lelia Bundles had been telling other people 's stories as a network news producer . Now she tells her family 's story to people who had never heard of Madam Walker . @!Ms-BUNDLES : That was the great part . Unidentified Woman 4 : It 's done . Thank you so much . @!Ms-BUNDLES : OK . Great . Unidentified Woman 5 : This is part of our history . It 's part of the legacy of America . Surely , it 's in all of our interest to know just a little bit -- just a little bit about someone who 's an icon . Unidentified Woman 6 : I think it 's time for people to know not just Madam 's name but her history , her legacy and what it takes to become a successful woman business owner . @!Ms-BUNDLES : This is really one of my treasures . This is the last letter that Madam wrote to her daughter , A'Lelia , before she died . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In just 15 years , she had amassed a fortune , built a hair-care empire and left her mark on black America . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) Unrealized was her dream of a new company headquarters and entertainment complex in Indianapolis . That would come after her death . Filmmaker Stanley Nelson . @!Mr-NELSON : But it was really built as a monument to Madam Walker , so it was just this incredible building that had a movie theater , and it was rumored to be the first movie theater that was built for black people in this country . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!Mr-NELSON : There were offices . There were stores . There was a soda fountain , restaurant .

' That was really the end of the gay times of the new Negro in Harlem , ' Langston Hughes wrote . ' The Depression brought everybody down a peg or two , and the Negroes had but a few pegs to fall . ' @(Footage-of-Walker-) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) The Walker Company held on for another half-century , finally closing its doors in 1986 . The Walker Building still stands , a tribute to the vision of its founder . @!Ms-BUNDLES : It 's a national historic landmark . It 's been restored , and it is really a marvelous place . It 's a -- a building where it has -- the building has now come to life again . @(Photograph-of-Walk) @!PINKSTON : @(Voiceover) And so , too , has Madam C.J. Walker .

##54368 CHARLES @!OSGOOD , host : For a rock performer , there 's no bigger night than this coming Wednesday , the night of the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles , unless it 's the night of a performance by a youth symphony orchestra in Burlington , Vermont . If that sounds a little fishy to you , you 're right . It is a bit ' phishy . ' That 's Phish spelled P-H-I-S-H. @(Footage-of-Phish-l) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) You may or may not have heard them on the radio , or seen them on MTV , but the group Phish gives an electrifying musical sideshow that is legendary in the world of rock and roll . They are musical acrobats , and their ringleader for 18 years -- since he was 18 -- has been Trey Anastasio. @(Footage-of-Phish-c) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) Phish is one of America 's top grossing live acts , and this year , their recordings have been nominated for two Grammys . They 've even got a Ben &amp; Jerry 's ice cream flavor named after them . But last fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( Voiceover ) Trey Anastasio left the path to superstardom to return to the back roads of Vermont . @(Footage-of-Trey-An) @!Mr-TREY-ANASTASIO- : Luckily Phish was an odd band , so we were pretending to be rock stars , I think . In reality , we were just a bunch of geeky Vermonters . But we had fun playing rock star , I think , for a while . @(Footage-of-house-e) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) And so after 15 albums and 1,400 performances , Trey is spending a lot of time in his 150-year-old barn outside of Burlington , holed up with the same old guitar but a lot of new ideas . @!Mr-ANASTASIO : You know , ' rock star ' has a lot of -- has a lot of -- there 's -- there 's other job qualifications you need for ' rock star ' ... @(Photographs-of-Phi) @!Mr-ANASTASIO : ... that -- that do n't have anything to do with being a musician .

It 's a lot of fun , but it 's not as fun as writing music . @(Photographs-of-Ana) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) After collaborating with some of the best in the business , guitar virtuosos like B.B. King and Neil Young , Trey has re-connected with the man who first taught him how to write music , his long time mentor , composer Ernie Stires. @(Footage-of-Anastas) @!Mr-ERNIE-STIRES-@1 : You have to find the originality within the mind of the guy and help him to do it , and maybe he has it and maybe he does n't . But if he 's original , and Trey is , that 's what I spotted . @(Footage-of-Vermont) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) So he pushed his most famous student further . Ernie had the idea of putting Trey together with the Vermont Youth Orchestra . @!Mr-TROY-PETERS-@1C : They 're actually in tempo here . @!Mr-ANASTASIO : Oh !

To see him , this big star , sit down in front of them and be almost intimidated , you know . It made them realize that this was something special . @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) More than just inviting Trey to play with his students , conductor Troy Peters invited him to compose for them , too . @!Mr-ANASTASIO : And you know what ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . There should be air , there should be ... @!Mr-PETERS : Mm-hmm . @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) For Trey , the opportunity was a first . @!Mr-ANASTASIO : The orchestral world can be a little judgmental of a rock star handing them a score . @(Footage-of-musical) @!Mr-ANASTASIO : ( Voiceover ) So one -- he would say , ' One way you can really win people over is to make sure you 're neat and clean and everything is readable , and all your sharps are where they should be , and your flats . ' @(Sings) He 's putting in the new bass line . @(Footage-of-Stires-) @!OSGOOD : ( Voiceover ) Trey composed a classical piece that is rooted in one of Phish 's best-known songs , a playful musical tale about a pig named Guyute. qwq @ ( Footage-of- " Guyute @!Mr-ANASTASIO : @(Sings) ' Guyute was the ugly pig ...

Do n't count it . Just feel it . Unidentified Girl 3 : I was thinking we could split it up , like maybe she could only do -- or I could only do the off-beat type things , then he other could do all the notes , and ... @!Mr-ANASTASIO : OK .

If you will , and the word I like to use is there is a memory of the experience . @(Footage-of-model-o) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Doctors now know that the spinal cord literally rewires itself and tells the brain there is pain even after there should n't be any .

But tell that to some doctors . @!Dr-PALMER : What I think a lot of these doctors want is they just want us to take that patient from them . They say , ' This is too complicated . I really do n't understand the pain pathways . I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs because of the legal implications . Just take them from me.

Cone snails from the Philippines inject paralyzing toxins into their prey ; they target the creature 's nervous system . Drug companies are adapting the toxins for human use . @!Dr-BASBAUM : Why do they work in a human or an animal ? Because the same receptor that exists in the prey of the snail -- it could be a fish , a small fish -- exists in my spinal cord , in your spinal cord . @(Footage-of-cone-sn) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) The spinal cord connection is what interested UCSF scientist Alan Basbaum in taking part in the snail research , in linking a new clue to the mystery of why the spinal cord develops that memory of pain that wo n't go away . @!Dr-BASBAUM : I mean , the good news is that the basic science of pain mechanisms has now identified a slew of new targets , new therapeutic targets .

##54372 BANDALOOP Announcer : It 's SUNDAY MORNING on CBS , and here again is Charles Osgood . @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : More often than not , if you want to see the dance troupe Bandaloop you 'll have to look at the unlikeliest of places , because as Rita Braver is about to show us , for Bandaloop all the world is a stage . @(Footage-of-Bandalo) @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) No , this is not a special effect . These people really are dancing 2,500 feet over Yosemite National Park . They are members of Project Bandaloop , a troupe dedicated to expanding the boundaries of dance , to define principles of gravity , to challenging perceptions of space . Their founder and guiding spirit is 37-year-old Amelia Rudolph , a longtime modern dancer and choreographer , who took up mountain climbing about 12 years ago . @(Voiceover) When did it sort of go , bingo , I can put these two together for you ? @!Ms-AMELIA-RUDOLPH- : @(Voiceover) It evolved . It was n't -- I -- I do n't think it was a single moment . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it improved my climbing . And also then to be out in nature and be -- having the inspiration of a natural place . The two just started to grow towards each other and blend in to each other . @(Footage-of-dancers) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Soon she was recruiting near her home in the San Francisco Bay Area . She went after dancers who could climb and climbers who could dance . The name Bandaloop came from a fictitious tribe in the Tom Robbins ' novel " Jitterbug Perfume , " a tribe that does a dance of longevity . @!Ms-RUDOLPH : I like the sound of it . I also like the idea that , you know , there 's a sort of magical elixir of activity that could somehow extend your vitality . And guess what ? There 's 40-year-old dancers in the company . @(Footage-of-dancers) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Both Kimmy Ward and Heather Baer are 40 . Teen-agers need not apply . At 25 , Mark Stuber is the youngest member of the company . Why is the youngest person in this troupe a 25-year-old rather than a 17-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of gravity to what we do emotionally , even though it 's this physical thing . @(Footage-of-dancers) @!Mr-STUBER : @(Voiceover) We 're really in it and -- and we 're lending it meaning as it 's happening . @(Footage-of-waterfa) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Nowhere is that need for maturity more obvious than in Yosemite . It 's a three-mile hike up to the staging area , a jagged cliff with Yosemite Falls as a backdrop . The dancers travel with a team of riggers . They triple test every rope , every wire , every bolt . And then the dancers triple check everything , too . @(Voiceover) I think people are going to ask , ' Have they ever had a serious accident ? ' Have you ? @!Ms-RUDOLPH : We 've not had a serious accident . I do think about it and I think that anybody who thinks , ' Oh , what a great idea . I think I 'll do that with my dance company , ' should call me . And I -- and I have had people call me , ' Hey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , too , you know . ' The first thing I say is , ' Then are you ready for somebody to die ? ' And that just wakes them right up . Like they do n't even -- like that does n't even occur to them . Because I never forget that the -- that gra -- you know , gravity does n't take a lunch break . @(Footage-of-perform) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) In addition to dancing off mountaintops , Bandaloop also tests gravity by dangling from public buildings , like the Space Needle in Seattle . And , believe it or not , Rudolph insists that her delight in this comes not from the sense of risk , but from the knowledge that she is exploring the relationship of gravity to movement . @(Voiceover) You love it for the dance . @!Ms-RUDOLPH : @(Voiceover) I love it for the dance . I love it for the re-creation of gravity . I love it for the redefinition of what a dance floor is . I love it for the redefinition of architecture , for the redefinition or re -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) It was Bandaloop 's different take on the world that brought the funding for this work in Yosemite . Wolf Trap , the national park for the performing arts , was launching a series of special projects to celebrate America 's other national parks . Wolf Trap president Terrence Jones fell in love when he watched a tape of Bandaloop in action . @!Mr-TERRENCE-JONES- : And I saw this incredible communion , if you will , between nature and sport and -- and the -- the physical environment . I thought , you know , ' This is it . This is exactly what we 're trying to do is to communicate through the language of the performing arts the special nature of these national parks . ' And so that 's why it worked so well . @(Footage-of-dancers) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) It took two years of planning and almost $ 1 million to line up the project , then a week of rehearsal on the mountaintop. @!Ms-RUDOLPH : @(Voiceover) And the dance floor was about 200 feet off -- down from the top of the cliff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into place . @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Naturally , the question arises ... Are these people nuts ? But why -- what makes you want to do something like that , fly over Yosemite ? @(Footage-of-Ward) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Dancer Kimmy Ward . @!Ms-KIMMY-WARD-@1Da : I think it 's the beauty of it . And there 's just this -- this freedom . @(Footage-of-perform) @!Ms-WARD : @(Voiceover) The -- the -- the expanding space that just keeps going and going and going . @!BRAVER : Is it as scary as it looks ? @!Ms-WARD : Do we make it look scary ? I ... Unidentified Dancer 1 : It 's scary . @!BRAVER : Yeah . It looks ... @!Ms-WARD : I think certainly psychologically there is that moment when -- for the first time when you 're settling into your rope when , ' OK , is it all going to work again this time ? ' But once you get in there and you settle in and you realize , yes , it 's OK , ' it 's OK . And then you get into the dance . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) The dancers shed their climbing clothes and move on to what they call a dance floor . They float and fly and twirl and spin and travel into a mystical dimension . A couple of months later , accompanied by live musicians , they perform at the Wolf Trap Theatre in Virginia in tandem with the video they made at Yosemite . Theater performances are rare for Bandaloop , and as you might imagine , their 's is not the sort of work that brings in much money , so the troupe depends mostly on grants . This summer they 've got funding to perform a series of pieces as they cross the Sierra , Nevada , range . Is there anyplace where you all ha -- have in your minds , like , ' Gee , this is where I 'd like to dance ' ? Or , ' I 'd like to make a dance on this ... ' @!Mr-STUBER : Yeah . @!Ms-WARD : Oh , there 's lots of them . Unidentified Dancer 2 : Guggenheim Bilbao . That would be nice . Unidentified Dancer 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? @!Ms-WARD : Yeah . Unidentified Dancer 4 : I 'd like to dance on the Eiffel Tower . Unidentified Dancer 3 : Yeah . Unidentified Dancer 4 : And I 'd like to dance in New York somewhere , because we 've never been to New York . And I 'd love to dance in New York . @(Footage-of-Rudolph) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Amelia Rudolph has her sights set even higher . @!Ms-RUDOLPH : Well , the other night I looked through a telescope at the moon . And I was thinking , ' My gosh , I think some of those craters are big enough that there -- I think there 's a vertical surface on them . ' @(Footage-of-the-moo) @!Ms-RUDOLPH : @(Voiceover) What an incredible thing it would be to travel there and make art . @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Ahead , a diverting visit to some contraptions in Connecticut . @(Announcements)

He 's made me nuts , he 's made me crazy ; I 've wanted to kill him . @(Photograph-of-the-) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) And in this marriage , murder is a real option . You see , Marty and Annette are more than a couple ; they 're collaborators . @(Footage-of-book-co) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Under the pen name Maan Meyers , they 've co-authored half a dozen murder mysteries . @!Mrs-MEYERS : It 's dangerous when we 're working together .

The trick of being a good actor , if you 're creating something , is have no governors on you whatsoever . You go , ' Blah ! ' so you just put it all out there . Maybe 50 percent is garbage . So what ? You throw it away , or you rewrite it . @!Mrs-MEYERS : I throw it away . @!Mr-MEYERS : You 're encouraging her . We both -- each want to be the boss . @!MASON : That is tough . @!Mr-MEYERS : It is. @!Mrs-MEYERS : Yes . @!MASON : That 's a problem . @!Mr-MEYERS : Yep . @!Mrs-MEYERS : In a marriage , it 's very difficult .

And that 's what makes a good mystery writer . @(Footage-of-skyscra) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Annette then unexpectedly stumbled into a new career as a headhunter on Wall Street . Then at lunch one day , a client excused himself to go to a phone booth . @!Mrs-MEYERS : And I could see him huddled over the telephone . And I thought , ' What if I open the door and he slides out dead ? ' And that 's how it started . @(Footage-of-book-co) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) She called it " The Big Killing .
