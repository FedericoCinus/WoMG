Subsequent to the appearance of Dewey 's discussions of that pedagogical stance , the National Council for the Social Studies published The Problems Approach and the Social Studies in 1955 and issued a revised version , Problem-Centered Social Studies Instruction : Approaches to Reflective Teaching , in 1971 ( Gross and Muessig 1971 ) . More recently , social science education specialists published research-based theoretical articles providing scholarly justifications for the use of inquiry activities in social studies classes , especially activities that have students using the methods of social scientists ( Mayer 1998 ; VanSickle and Hoge 1991 ) . Since 1990 , authors of numerous articles have recommended the use of problem-centered instruction in secondary social studies classes ( e.g. , Benoit 1998 ; Gallagher 2000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes 1994 ) , including classes for students with learning disabilities ( O'Brien 2000 ) . During that period , other authors have recommended that for secondary social studies classes , teachers should consider a relative of problem-centered instruction -- the case method ( Guyer , Dillon , Anderson , and Szobota 2000 ; Wasserman 1992 ) . Other social science education experts writing on the promotion of thinking and inquiry about real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes have referred to " authentic instruction " ( Foster and Padgett 1999 ; Newmann 1990 ) . Still others have built their preferred methods around social issues ( Evans 1998 ; Rossi 1996 ; Shaver 1992 ) . At present , an entire book is in print on the use of cooperative problem-solving methods in secondary social studies classes ( Hickman and Wigginton 1999 ) . Another available book features the use of problem-based learning in social studies classes from the elementary grades through college ( Moye 1998 ) , and one is in print on the social issues approach ( Evans and Saxe 1996 ) . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers respond to John Dewey 's recommendation that teachers engage students by using thinking and inquiry tasks reflecting real-world concerns and interests . Challenges in Using Inquiry Methods <p> Widespread support for Dewey 's recommendation does not easily translate into widespread , sustained application of the recommendation , however . Researchers who have investigated the use of problem-centered instruction in social studies classes ( Ehman , Glenn , Johnson , and White 1992 ; Saye and Brush 1999 ) point to the time demands on students and teachers , the need for and frequent lack of relevant prior knowledge on the students ' part , and the importance of expert guidance for students during the problem-solving process , even when much guidance is built into computer-based activities . Even enthusiastic supporters of issues-oriented instruction in social studies classes point to the challenges faced by users of the approach ( Rossi 1995 ; Rossi and Pace 1998 ) . In fact , authors of recent articles focus specifically on ways to overcome barriers that discourage social studies teachers from applying inquiry methods centered on real-world concerns and interests ( Evans , Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like most of the authors cited above , we are firm believers in the use of thinking and inquiry tasks that reflect real-world concerns and interests and are committed users of such tasks in our university classrooms . Because of our interest in the method , we are disappointed to see the relative infrequency with which teachers use thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes . We recognize , however , that the ill-structured tasks meant to typify problem-based learning can create substantial instructional challenges for teachers . We recognize , too , that the controversial issues recommended for issues-centered instruction can create unpleasant conflict in teachers ' lives . <p> We believe , however , that many teachers can move toward the more complex forms of thinking and inquiry methods and those forms that more realistically simulate the actual work of social scientists . In many secondary social studies classes , the teachers may have to begin with thinking and inquiry tasks that are relatively modest in complexity and that perhaps require only textbook information and classroom time to carry them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not pretend to be historians , political scientists , or psychologists . In this article , we identify several types of thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on concerns or interests of adolescents but do so at varying levels of complexity and require students to use a range of informational resources . The types of tasks discussed are less complex than the ill-structured tasks recommended by proponents of problem-based learning and the case method , and the tasks put less demand on the thinking and investigation skills of students than the tasks typical of those two instructional approaches or of issues-centered instruction . <p> To begin our discussion , we must emphasize a fact of which veteran secondary teachers are fully aware : Anticipating whether a certain thinking or inquiry task will tap into a concern or interest of a specific adolescent is virtually impossible without knowing the individual very well . The available research on the concerns and interests of young adults may be reassuring for social studies teachers who have incorrectly predicted the effectiveness of a creatively constructed thinking or inquiry task with a certain secondary student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that the typical concerns and interests of young adults vary with their age ( Hendry , Glendinning , and Shucksmith 1996 ) , the influence of their parents and socioeconomic status ( Kasser , Ryan , Zax , and Sameroff 1995 ) , and societal circumstances ( Easterlin and Crimmins 1991 ; Ovadia 2003 ) . In short , no simple , unchanging guidelines can be developed for creating thinking and inquiry tasks that can reliably capitalize on concerns of specific secondary students . To design such tasks , teachers must draw on what they can learn about individual students and about specific groups of students . Tasks Reflecting Students ' Concerns and Interests <p> Despite that caveat , we present in figure 1 several types of tasks that can take advantage of the concerns or interests of adolescents . To understand the information in figure 1 fully , the reader must refer to the appendix of this article . We drew on our experiences with secondary students to identify the types of tasks and to construct the sample tasks illustrating those types . During the process of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1990 ) , " The Personal Relevance of the Social Studies , " in which he offers a " personal-relevance framework " by which he categorizes typical human goals . He sorts them first into four general motivations -- sense of security , sense of affiliation , sense of competence , and sense of influence -- and then into five areas of life -- human relationships , occupation , health and safety , personal development , and finances . Even after we had developed most of the suggested task types and examples , we found his framework helpful for creating additional thinking and inquiry tasks to tap into the concerns of adolescents . <p> The reader should examine the figure and the appendix before continuing with the article . We wrote the sample tasks using sentence structure and vocabulary that we assumed readers of The Social Studies would understand . For some secondary social studies classes , modifications in the sentence structure and vocabulary are needed . <p> We do not mean the types of uses of social studies content and the sample tasks that we present to be definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to illustrate the content uses on which social studies teachers can build instruction . The sample tasks need not be like academic or professional applications of course content or resemble academic or professional tasks . The tasks can have a personal use and have a high probability of being viewed as relevant to adolescents , even if the students are not concerned about the content as academic content . We are impressed by many of the thinking and inquiry tasks suggested in the teacher 's edition of current secondary social studies textbooks , but we find that most of the tasks involve uses that would seem realistic primarily to academic specialists in the subject area , to professionals in careers related to the subject area , or to students who are already intensely interested in the subject area . We believe that all students should be exposed to such uses but that they also should be allowed and enabled to see that social studies content can be used in ways that they recognize as relevant . Features of Effective Use of Inquiry Methods <p> We do not intend this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry tasks in secondary social studies classrooms . The articles and books we cited provide excellent discussions of that nature . We also recommend helpful articles and books with no specific subject area focus by Beamon ( 2002 ) , Fogarty ( 1997 ) , Lambros ( 2004 ) , Krynock and Robb ( 1999 ) , Renzulli ( 2000,2001 ) , Souders and Prescott ( 1999 ) , and Torp and Sage ( 2002 ) . Although we do not propose an overall framework for incorporating thinking and inquiry tasks into secondary social studies instruction , we suggest several features that are also recommended in the discussions of many experts on problem-based learning and related instructional approaches . One suggestion is that in secondary classrooms , small-group collaborative inquiry , rather than individual inquiry , often leads to better inquiry products and better learning . Collaboration usually capitalizes on the " five heads are better than one " phenomenon , which leads to high-quality inquiry products . Students in a small group can learn from others ' explanations of tasks , concepts , and larger ideas and from others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquiry tasks , teachers should offer options from which students can choose . For example , a teacher could include as options a selection of tasks from the teacher 's edition of the course textbook and several of the teacher-created tasks presented in this article . Allowing students to choose the tasks that they will carry out increases the chance that they will be interested in the topics , that they have the investigation skills needed for the tasks , and that they have useful prior knowledge . Those three circumstances can produce the motivation and capabilities required for successful task completion . Nevertheless , even when students work in groups on tasks involving topics of interest to them and on tasks for which they have relevant investigation skills and prior knowledge , they need to be monitored by the teacher to provide guidance and other support . <p> We believe that the successful use of thinking and inquiry tasks by a secondary social studies teacher who has not already incorporated problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , or a related approach into her or his classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to develop the requisite management skills and procedures before considering large-scale use of one of the approaches . Moreover , the students need to develop their thinking , investigation , and collaboration skills , which are essential for successful participation in the approaches . One reason we believe in the types of thinking and inquiry tasks presented in this article is that the teacher 's and student 's skills improve through such tasks and can eventually be applied to the types of tasks typically recommended by proponents of problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , and other inquiry approaches for social studies classes . Although the sample tasks presented here are low to moderate in complexity and in the demands placed on students ' thinking and investigation skills , the use of such types of tasks can lay the foundation for successful use of more complex and more demanding thinking and inquiry tasks .

##4002468 Key words : economics and September 11 , 2001 ; economics and terrorism ; economic approach to modern problems <p> To many Western observers , the behavior of people in the Middle East is a mystery . The area is the scene of brutality and seemingly senseless acts of violence . Why has there been so much turmoil there for so long ? A brief review of past events helps to establish the context of the problem . Partition of Palestine <p> The United Nations voted in 1947 to partition Palestine , the British mandate , into two states -- one for Jews and one for Palestinian Arabs . Through political pressure , the Jewish state assimilated large tracts of land belonging to Palestinians and through intimidation forced three hundred thousand Palestinian Arabs to leave their homes and land and to become refugees . <p> In 1948 , when the British gave up Palestine and the United Nations divided Palestine , Israel became an independent state . Palestinian refugees mounted protests in an attempt to get back their land and homes . Through the efforts of provocations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used its army to attack the Palestinian Arabs . Facing death , seven hundred thousand more Palestinians fled their homes and land in terror . Israel promptly announced that it would annex the newly vacated land as a part of the new nation . <p> Angered by that act by Israel , the neighboring Arab countries attacked Israel so that the seven hundred thousand Palestinian refugees could return to their homes and land . The five attacking countries were also former British colonies , and therefore their newly formed armies were ill equipped and poorly trained . By contrast , the United States was committed to the defense of Israel and gave Israel the military equipment and financial means to fight the war successfully . The Israeli forces prevailed in the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 . With the military victory of 1948 , Israel had the political advantage in negotiations over Palestine , and the 1 million displaced Palestinian Arabs became permanent refugees . <p> Angered and demoralized by the events of 1948 , the Arab League refused to recognize Israel as a state and demanded that all Palestine refugees be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Israel had the upper hand militarily and that the United States gave Israel $4 billion a year in military and financial aid , the Arab League recognized that the imbalance of power favoring Israel would remain indefinitely . Retaliation against Israel began to take different forms . Because of their frustration at the political advantage that Israel and the United States had in the region , protesters resorted to acts of terror , which became widespread in the Middle East . Other Events Affecting the Turmoil in the Middle East <p> In 1953 , the United States helped Iran 's military stage a coup , overthrowing the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq , whom the United States feared might be a communist threat . The United States then reinstalled the hated Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as the Shah of Iran . <p> In 1968 , Arab militants hijacked an El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv . That was followed by decades of hostage taking , hijackings , and assassinations , which characterized the strategy used by Arab militant groups . <p> In 1972 , eight Arab commandos from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Munich Olympic Games . <p> In 1973 , the Nixon administration provided Israel with the means of producing an atomic bomb . <p> In 1979 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led a revolution in Iran , overthrowing the U.S.-supported Shah of Iran and taking sixty-six Americans hostage for fifteen months . <p> In 1983 , a truck bomb exploded at the U.S. marine barracks in Lebanon , killing 241 soldiers . The United States subsequently withdrew from Lebanon . <p> After the Iranian Air Flight 655 with 290 passengers was accidentally shot down by the USS Vincennes missile cruiser in Iranian waters in 1986 , the crew of the Vincennes was rewarded with military medals for their bravery . <p> In 1993 , the World Trade Center in New York City was bombed , killing six . <p> In 1996 , a truck bomb exploded outside U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia . <p> In 1998 , bombs exploded outside U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . The United States linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden . <p> In 2000 , the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen 's Aden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . <p> On September 11 , 2001 , hijackers crashed two planes into the World Trade Center buildings in New York City , killing more than two thousand people , and another into the Pentagon , headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense . A fourth plane bound for either the White House or the Capitol crashed in Pennsylvania before reaching its target . The United States linked Osama bin Laden to the attack . An Economic Analysis <p> Those seem to be senseless acts . In many cases , the terrorists themselves died in the attack . How can such behavior be considered rational ? Explaining such behavior is troublesome if one teaches high school economics . After all , the most basic assumption of economics is that people act in their own best interest . Paul Heyne , well known for his textbook The Economic Way of Thinking , states : <p> The theories of economics , with surprisingly few exceptions , are simple extensions of the assumptions that individuals take those actions they think will yield them the largest net advantage . Everyone , it is assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spendthrift , saint or sinner , consumer or seller , politician or business executive , cautious calculator or spontaneous improviser. ( 1994,5 ) <p> It is nearly impossible to reconcile the behavior of terrorists with the behavior of the rational , self-interested individuals whom Heyne and many others associate with the economics approach . Should economics teachers suggest that economic theory applies to all sorts of people , at many times and across many cultures , but that some people in the Middle East are somehow a special class exempt from basic economic theory ? If people in the Middle East are not exempt from economic theory , what should a high school teacher say ? How would an economist approach the problem of Middle East terror ? Specifically , let us consider the events of September 11 , 2001 . How Were the Terrorists Organized and Financed ? <p> The al Qaeda network is headed by the Emir General ( Osama bin Laden ) and his immediate lieutenants , Ayman Al-Zawahiri ( al-Jihid ) and Mohammed Atef ( Military Operations ) . Other leaders have assigned roles in areas dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the media . The al Qaeda network is largely a decentralized operation , with individual terrorist cells playing key roles . <p> Al Qaeda has established several key alliances . Among the most important are the following : <p> -- Al-Jihad ( Egypt ) : assassination of Sadat in 1981 <p> -- Hamas ( West Bank/Gaza ) : ongoing attacks against Israel <p> -- Hezbollah ( Lebanon ) : bombing of the U.S. embassy in 1983 <p> -- GIA ( Algeria ) : planned millennium attacks <p> -- Harakat-al-Mujadi : completed terrorist actions in Pakistan <p> -- Abu-Sayyaf : completed terrorist actions in the Philippines <p> Al Qaeda could not survive without sources of funds and protection . Osama bin Laden was able to launch al Qaeda in part with funding from his own personal fortune and businesses , which have been estimated to be worth $150 million . ( Considering that al Qaeda likely spent no more than $200,000 on the entire September 11 operation , bin Laden 's fortune can support numerous acts of terrorism ) . To survive , al Qaeda and similar groups need the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can shelter them from apprehension and allow them to conduct business . Afghanistan and Iraq were widely regarded as states willing to harbor terrorist groups . Additional sources of funds come from Islamic charities and individual wealthy families in the Persian Gulf . Drug trafficking also contributed to al Qaeda 's income . Rational Behavior <p> The organization and finances of al Qaeda suggest that terrorist acts are planned by rational people who lead terrorist groups . Those leaders seek to benefit even while some of their followers are destroyed . They view their actions in much the same way as military leaders view war casualties -- as a price to be paid . <p> The organization and finances of al Qaeda also reveal that the actions of al Qaeda are influenced by the existence of goals . They are making choices that , given available information , they hope will go farthest toward achieving those ends . The long-term goals of al Qaeda include the following : <p> -- The liberation of Saudi Arabia and other countries from U.S. troops <p> -- The replacement of pro-Western regimes with militant Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Muslim control over holy places in Jerusalem <p> To accomplish its long-term goals , al Qaeda identified the United States as the primary enemy . Following its goal-orientated behavior , al Qaeda made meticulous plans , arranged for logistical support , and aimed for efficiency in its execution of specific acts of terrorism . It took several specific actions that were intended to destabilize the <p> U.S. economy and reduce U.S. influence in the Middle East . In that sense , then , the actions of terrorist groups such as al Qaeda appear to be rational rather than the result of some form of psychosis . Economic Analysis of Criminal Behavior <p> For a deeper understanding of the economics approach to terrorism , let us turn to related areas of economic theory and research . Economists for many years have studied human behavior in areas beyond the production of goods and services . Economists , for example , have studied behavior in such areas as dating , voting , fertility , obesity , racial discrimination , and criminal behavior . <p> We decided to examine how the economic analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts , after all , can be viewed as simply another form of criminal behavior . Terrorists , like other criminals , violate laws and hurt innocents as they pursue their aims . <p> Sociologists and other intellectuals have argued that the root causes of crime are to be found in such things as racism , poverty , discrimination , lack of jobs , and globalization . In that line of analysis , little can be done in the short term to change criminal behavior . Actions that should be taken include expanding the rights of the accused , reducing sentences , expanding probation , and tightening restrictions on police . <p> Gary S. Becker , the Nobel Prizewinning economist from the University of Chicago , approached the problem of criminal behavior differently . He applied the economic way of thinking to criminal behavior . Becker and Becker ( 1997 ) state that criminals , like everyone else , respond to incentives in predictable ways . For example , more college students go into computer science and chemical engineering when earnings and other advantages are rising in those fields . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . <p> Similarly , from the 1950s until the 1980s , more people were induced to commit crimes because they were responding to incentives . The incentive structure had changed to reward more criminal behavior . That was a period when judges issued less severe sentences and many convicted criminals never actually served time . As a result , crime became a more attractive " occupation . " <p> From his research , Becker concluded that ways had to be found to change incentives influencing criminal behavior . Becker and Becker ( 1997 ) point out that the revival of the economic analysis of crime led to actions that reduced crime levels . As the probabilities of apprehending criminals and punishing those convicted increased , crime began to decline . Studies revealed that crimes of passion as well as crimes against property were reduced by making punishment more certain and severe . <p> Becker 's studies can be applied to the behavior of terrorist groups such as al Qaeda . The key is to begin with a focus on incentives to terrorists . A case can be made that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives that rewarded terrorist behavior . The United States used almost no military response in the wake of several terrorist attacks , including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole . Groups such as al Qaeda watched the American response carefully . The lack of action provided an incentive to commit additional acts of terror . <p> Can swift and decisive action deter terrorism ? At first glance , common sense would suggest that that is the case . Empirical studies offer some additional specific evidence . Enders , Sandler , and Cauley ( 1990 ) studied the effects of metal detector technology on the number of skyjacking incidents . They found that the fall in transnational skyjacking was statistically significant after such technology was in place . <p> But the difficulty of applying direct retaliation as the complete solution to terrorist behavior lies within the nature of terrorism . In many acts of terrorism , the perpetrator is a suicide bomber . The planners and leaders are unknown or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty . Another way to approach incentives for terrorists is to deal directly with the root problems that cause the terrorism . For example , U.S. troops on the Muslim holy ground of Saudi Arabia have caused much of the animosity toward the United States ; so much so that the United States is very quietly removing U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia . Internationalizing the Old City of Jerusalem and all the holy shrines in Israel under the UN would be another step to ending a great deal of religious animosity and a major cause of terrorism . Why the World Trade Center Buildings and the Pentagon ? <p> Al Qaeda sees plainly that the United States is the financial supporter that keeps Israel strong . The United States gives Israel and Egypt each $4 billion a year in aid . On almost every major building in Israel , one can find plaques filled with names of contributors from the United States . Moreover , the United States is a symbol of much of what Muslim terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are against . A strike against the strongest military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and globalization was viewed as a fundamental goal . By attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , al Qaeda wanted to make Americans take notice of what the United States was doing wrong in the Middle East . <p> A strike on the United States had a practical side as well ; it was a good target . As an open system with the basic freedoms of a democratic society , many of the protective screens against terrorism were simply not in place . Air transportation policies were designed to help business travelers and tourists get to their destinations with a minimum of hassle . Those policies were not focused on the dangers posed by a purposeful , determined , ruthless , and well-trained group of terrorists . Technology and communications are well developed in the United States , which also made it easier for the terrorists to plan and execute their operations . The Economic Impact <p> The terrorists who planned the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , understood that New York City is the financial center of the United States , the home of the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations maintain their headquarters there , making the city the heart of the foreign exchange market and a vital link in international trade relations . <p> The shock of the September 11 attacks may well have done more damage than even al Qaeda had imagined possible . An economy that was already showing signs of weakness moved further into recession . The psychological effects of the attacks adversely affected consumer spending . Air travel dropped at the same time as oil prices increased . That double whammy produced great difficulties for the airline industries , which soon sought and received help from the federal government to remain in business . <p> Other industries were affected as well : <p> -- Insurance companies faced with large payouts raised worries about rate increases . <p> -- Manufacturers worried about disruptions of supplies began to rethink " just-in-time " inventories and other efficiencies that depended on quick and uninterrupted transportation . <p> -- Concerns increased about the stability of future energy supplies . <p> Because of concerns that the events of September 11 would further contribute to an emerging economic recession , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly approved , which included spending for homeland defense and rebuilding New York 's financial district . Subsequently , a $60- to $75-billion stimulus package was approved , which included a $15 billion relief package for airlines . A Teaching Suggestion <p> How might a high school economics teacher approach September 11 with his or her students ? We offer this suggestion . Pose the following mystery to the class : <p> A basic assumption of economics is that people act rationally , in their own self interest . On September 11 , members of al Qaeda led suicide attacks that killed more than two thousand people , including the terrorists themselves . How can terrorist acts , such as those of September 11 , be viewed as rational and self-interested ? Is n't terrorism the work of irrational zealots ? <p> Remind the students of some of the key points of the economic way of thinking , such as the following : <p> -- People choose . They try to select the best combination of benefits and costs . <p> -- People 's choices involve costs . <p> -- People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose the following true or false statements to the class , and allow the students to discuss their responses : <p> 1 . Terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are poorly organized groups of misfits . <p> False . Encourage several responses from the students , but point out that al Qaeda was , in fact , a well-organized network with a leadership structure and a decentralized approach . <p> 2 . Terrorist groups such as al Qaeda have only a vague sense of purpose . <p> False . Stress that al Qaeda had a set of goals , including removing all United States presence from Saudi Arabia and destroying Israel . <p> 3 . Terrorist groups , like criminals in the United States , respond to incentives in predictable ways . <p> True . After several student responses , stress the analysis of criminal behavior by Gary S. Becker , who claims that criminals and even terrorists respond to economic incentives . <p> Ask the students to solve the mystery . The economic way of thinking suggests that terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are acting in a rational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inspire them and many others . The failure of the United States and others to respond swiftly to earlier terrorist attacks or to address the concerns in the Middle East raised by the Arab community as a whole helped provide an incentive for further , more dramatic attacks . The failure to act eventually resulted in severe economic damage . It set the stage for retaliation against governments that support terrorist organizations , including Afghanistan and Iraq . Conclusions and Further Resources <p> Economics is usually associated with matters having to do with the operation of markets and behavior in the private sector . Pioneering economists over the past several years have expanded the scope of the economics approach to include such social behavior as crime , dating , fertility , voting , and so forth . This article , influenced by the work of economists such as Gary S. Becker , illustrates how an economics approach can be applied to terrorist acts and used in high school economics classes . <p> High school economics teachers who are interested in similar approaches should visit http : //www.ncee.net/ and examine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2003 ) . The curriculum has forty-five lessons for teaching high school economics and seven new economic mysteries that apply the economic way of thinking to such things as couch potatoes and voter turnout . <p> 
##4002469 Key words : content standards ; experiential education ; service-learning ; social studies ; science ; archaeology <p> Experiential education , developed more than a century ago , is a guide for instructors interested in helping students capture the meaning of their learning experiences . John Dewey ( 1963 ) in Experience and Education emphasized that events are present and operative but that what concerns us is their meaning . Dewey judged the quality of an educational experience by its intellectual and moral benefits to the student and the long-term benefits to the community . For example , students may learn about ethics , character , and citizenship through the planned study of archaeology , but it is the instructor who is responsible for creating the situation , conditions for further growth of curiosity , and desire and purpose ( Moe , Coleman , Fink , and Krejs 2002 ) . <p> Lewin ( 1952 ) proposed that personal development occurs through the successful realization of goals achieved by a process of trial and error or through experimentation . That approach is a contrast to the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve . Experiential education is different from the traditional education of the nineteenth century because of an added emphasis on subjective and objective knowledge in the process of creating knowledge through action and its emphasis on social rewards ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) . Experiential education includes different types of individualized and group learning experiences . A popular form of experiential education is service learning , which aims to enhance students ' understanding through active participation in community activities . According to Florida International University ( 2004 ) , the goals of service-learning projects for young adults include the following : <p> -- To enhance student learning by joining theory with experience and thought with action <p> -- To assist students to see the relevance of the academic subject to the real world <p> -- To develop an environment of collegial participation among students , faculty members , and the community <p> -- To increase the civic and citizenship skills of students <p> -- To develop a richer context for student learning <p> -- To give students greater responsibility for their learning <p> Today , service-learning requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The National Service-Learning Cooperative ( 2002 ) defines service learning as a method of teaching and learning method that connects meaningful community-service experience with academic learning , personal growth , and civic responsibility . <p> According to a National Household Education Survey , 80 percent of public high schools offered service-learning opportunities during that year ( Mintz and Liu 1994 ) . Two-thirds of American schools arranged service work for students in grades six through twelve , matching opportunities with volunteers . Twenty-one percent of schools required that students complete a specific number of service hours before graduation . More than one-half of secondary students participated in service learning in 1999 ( Kleiner and Chapman 1999 ) . <p> To assess the benefits of engaging students in service learning , Eyler and Giles ( 1999 ) surveyed more than 1,500 students selected from twenty institutions of higher education to determine cognitive outcomes of service-learning projects . Students reported enhanced understanding of course material , new awareness of complexity of personal and social issues , and practical ability to apply course content . Higher quality service-learning experiences fostered development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in volunteer archaeology field work enhances students ' understanding of the scientific method as applied to the study of human history . Ten important principles of good practice provided direction to program planners and educators ( Cooper 2003 ) . <p> Relationship of Service-Learning Experiences to Discipline-Specific Standards Service learning is compatible with general and discipline-specific educational standards ( Moe , Coleman , Fink , and Krejs 2002 ; Cooper 2003 ) . The National Education Goals for the year 2000 emphasized preparing students for responsible citizenship , including involving America 's students in community service activities ( Brown 1998 ; Kleiner and Chapman 1999 ) . Specific social studies and science standards are compatible with planned experiences for student service learning . The National Council for the Social Studies ( NCSS 2003 ) promotes a set of curriculum standards and performance expectations . Three of the ten thematic strands are particularly relevant to experiential education through archaeology projects : culture ; time , continuity , and change ; and people , places , and environments . The culture strand includes " experiences that provide for the study of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continuity and change includes " experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time . " Finally , the strand of people , places and environments includes " experiences that provide for the study of people , places , and environments . " States may elect to use those strands as a guide in the development of local curricula . Table 1 contains selected content standards for the disciplines of social studies and science that were approved by the Alabama State Board of Education to guide classroom and field instruction . By using a combination of instructional methods ( lecture , reading and writing assignments , laboratory and field experiences ) , teachers increase the likelihood of achieving those content standards . <p> Archaeology offers a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary learning ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ) . According to Cooper ( 2003 ) , " teaching archaeology enhances students ' proficiency in critical thinking and reveals to them the process of historical interpretation . " Archaeology service learning is distinctive from volunteer work because " it affords active learning through workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is certainly possible for groups of middle and high school students to learn about social studies and to participate in outdoor recreational activities . With planned classroom activities , teachers can introduce students to the scientific method and have them apply research skills during their study of the past inhabitants of a specific region . <p> Many states offer volunteer archaeology field experiences through universities , archaeological and anthropological societies , and museums . These are ideal opportunities for student field trips and parent-child excursions . Social studies teachers may help parents to understand the connections between field work and reaching standards for student achievement . For instance , the Alabama Museum of Natural History has formed partnerships with high school history teachers and guidance counselors to recruit and select student participants for its summer field school . <p> Archaeology projects vary according to the instructional goals of the social studies classroom teacher . Although not all teachers can supervise off-campus visits to observe archaeologists at excavations or conservation sites , they can develop a WebQuest student research project ( see online examples and template for teachers at http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WebQuest in 1997 ( DiscoverySchool.com 2003 ) . Her aims were to facilitate student group work to research the similarities between Roman civilization and our own and to explore how Roman civilization has influenced us . Medieval Japan Newspaper WebQuest ( Heath n.d. ) is another example of a social studies research project for teaching students about the culture of a past civilization . An Educator 's Experiences <p> During the summers of 2001-03 , my children and I participated in three different archaeology field expeditions held in three southeastern states . The first was a joint field school venture in the George Washington National Forest , conducted by the USDA Forest Service ( FS ) and the Archeological Society of Virginia . The second summer , we were at an FS laboratory school in the DeSoto National Forest in coastal Mississippi . The third was hosted by the University of Alabama Museum of Natural History at San Estevan in remote southwestern Alabama . That was the site of a former settlement established on the frontier of the Mississippi territory in the early nineteenth century . <p> Our family 's primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become self-sufficient when apart from modern conveniences and technology . We successfully combined family camping vacations with volunteer fieldwork -- learning while recreating . Our secondary goal was to satisfy university and high school community service-learning requirements . We accomplished all goals . <p> The natural scenery of each site was spectacular . Hidden Valley is nestled in a secluded area near the resort villages of Warm Springs and Hot Springs , Virginia . On our way to the field site , we visited Falling Springs Water Fall , described by Thomas Jefferson as one of the great natural wonders of Virginia . After days of fieldwork , tired muscles found relief in the Jefferson Baths , hot mineral springs used for healing for centuries . <p> In Mississippi , we cavorted in warm clear lake waters adjacent to our tent site at the conclusion of each day in the laboratory . The campsite was in Flint Creek Waterpark , part of the Pat Harrison Waterway District . The Tombigbee River flowed adjacent to the Alabama site . During our free time , we swam in a clean and refreshing lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Oligocene and Eocene eras . <p> While hiking along fields and rocky river beds in each state , we came upon diverse fauna : buck deer , does and fawns , rabbits , turkey , turtles , one splashy beaver , an elusive mountain cat , frogs and salamanders , and a myriad of insects . We gladly joined other archaeology volunteers to share fellowship , meals , stories , songs , and games . The Passport in Time Program <p> Passport in Time ( PIT ) is an exciting volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program of the Forest Service . Individuals and families learn through experiential field and laboratory work that can last several days or weeks . Throughout the year , PIT volunteers learn to survey and excavate archaeological sites , rehabilitate rock art and historic sites , gather oral histories and archival data , and write interpretive brochures for future visitors . PIT sites are numerous across the national forests , grasslands , and prairies managed by the USDA Forest Service . The print and online PIT newsletter features stories about past projects , future opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 ; USDA Forest Service , Southern Region 1998 ) . <p> Gordon Peters , the founder of PIT , taught field schools at FS sites in Minnesota . Naturalists from lakeside resorts brought guests to see archeologists at work , and that became a popular outing . In response to requests from the naturalists and FS interpretive specialists , Peters agreed to continue his fieldwork and invite volunteers to participate . " That was the beginning of something beautiful ! " Peters said ( Passport in Time 2001 ) . <p> In 1989-90 , the project expanded to FS sites in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , and Utah . In 1991 , archaeologist Mike Beckes convinced FS administrators to recognize PIT officially as a national program . Since its inception , PIT projects have been conducted in 117 national forests in thirty-six states . Many of those sites would not have been thoroughly investigated without the efforts of dedicated adult and youth volunteers . According to the program 's officials , " Volunteers have helped to stabilize ancient cliff dwellings in New Mexico , excavate a 10,000-year-old village site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clean vandalized rock art in Colorado , survey for sites in a rugged Montana wilderness , and excavate a nineteenth-century Chinese mining site in Hell 's Canyon in Idaho " ( Passport in Time 2001 ) . University of Alabama Field School <p> The University of Alabama Museum of Natural History sponsors a related archaeology field school . The museum 's origins date from 1831 with the establishment of its first natural history specimens . The museum collections were reestablished in 1872 after destruction by fire during the Civil War . Today , holdings include the only meteorite known to have struck a human ; fossils ; and rocks and minerals from the Coal , Dinosaur , and Ice Ages ; there are also changing exhibits . Moundville Archaeological Park , a 320-acre National Historic Landmark , was added to the museum in 1929 . Moundville contains more than twenty preserved fourteenth-century Indian mounds ( Hall 2003 ) . <p> For the past twenty-five years , high school and college students have worked under the close supervision of museum staff members , experienced student peer leaders , and contract archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first field school site was Moundville Archaeological Park . The University of Alabama Field School was established for two purposes : to increase high school students ' interest in sciences and to recruit bright and talented students to enroll at the university ( Hall 2003 ) . The mean age of student volunteers is fourteen years . Adult volunteers are welcome to work cooperatively with the target audience of high school students . Readers can learn more about past expeditions at http : **33;4372;TOOLONG . Participants <p> Volunteers for the three projects came from many states -- Alabama , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , Ohio , Texas , Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia . High school and college students worked in small field teams that varied in size from four to twelve members , depending on assigned tasks . All teams in Virginia , Mississippi , and Alabama included youths and adults working together . Each age group benefited from the perspectives of the other . <p> The adult volunteers were a diverse group of retired seniors , a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and college teachers enjoying a different type of vacation . The naturalist and historians were Alabama state employees who sought to develop more effective teaching strategies for history and science , engage youth in conservation projects , and encourage future college enrollment . Most team leaders were experienced college students . Team members shared equal responsibility to maintain safe , clean , and secure campsites and excavation areas . <p> American volunteers felt fortunate to share our natural wonders and culture with international graduate students who hailed from the United Kingdom , Northern Ireland , and New Zealand . Those students were participants in a cooperative residency program with USDA Forest Service . Principles of Good Practice <p> Program sponsors incorporated ten important principles of good practice into the archaeology service-learning projects : intention , planning , orientation , clarity , authenticity , monitoring , reflection , evaluation , recognition , and continuous improvement ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) . Social studies teachers and their students can apply these ten principles to judge the merits of similar projects that offer service learning or course credit outside planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators was to define specific learning and knowledge that they intended students to gain from service-learning projects in social studies . Two aims were to have students gain appreciation and interest in the sciences , natural history , and archaeology and to learn to apply the scientific method to planning and conducting excavations of prehistoric and historic sites . Service-learning projects may vary from single day visits to a historic site to extended fieldwork lasting several days . <p> The University of Alabama Museum of Natural History sponsors an archaeology field school . The museum dates from 1831 , and its holdings include the only meteorite known to have struck a human . <p> Sponsors began planning more than one year before the expeditions began , selecting and mapping sites , obtaining test auger samples , meeting local residents , and obtaining required federal and state permits . School site partners in each state ( teachers and administrators ) helped to determine which grades and classes would visit ongoing excavations . Although several schools wanted to bring entire grades to visit field sites , administrators limited the number of student observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts and possible injuries to students . <p> Six months before summer expeditions , sponsors were busy hiring and training team leaders , promoting program participation among schools , and soliciting volunteer applications from adults and students . Planning steps during the spring included obtaining medical and personal information from volunteers ; gathering release-from-liability forms ; mailing maps and driving directions ; assembling equipment , tools , and foodstuffs ; and securing approval for high school course credit . The month before their arrival at the expeditions , the student and adult volunteers received written and electronic material as an orientation to the history of the site . Teachers will find that books with a regional focus on archaeology are useful to orient students ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ; Samford and Ribblett 1995 ; Zschomler and Brown 1996 ) . <p> On the way to the Alabama site , we joined the members of the Alabama Archaeological Society in Montgomery , the capital . The curator of the Native American and antebellum collections led the group in a private tour of the extensive collections of the state archives , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the area of excavation . That was a rare opportunity not usually offered to students or the general public . <p> Ongoing communication was essential to achieve clarity of purpose . Oral presentation and written materials presented volunteer expectations , responsibilities , project timelines , and projected outcomes of archaeology fieldwork . Working at the Site <p> When we arrived at field sites in Virginia , Mississippi , and Alabama , the project sponsors oriented the volunteers to the natural history of the field site and the lifestyles and descendants of early inhabitants . We learned the results of past work and viewed samples of artifacts that we were likely to discover . In Alabama , the students toured a local county museum with a collection of artifacts . <p> Sponsors and educators presented protocols and procedures to follow when excavating or identifying and preparing artifacts for laboratory study . Those included methods of dry and wet screening , reporting significant finds , preserving all artifacts , and protecting excavation sites ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ; Hall 2003 ; Passport in Time and Archaeological Society of Virginia 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the scientific method to archaeology fieldwork . Experienced college students or adult volunteers supervised the work of the youngest students . Our tasks varied from careful excavation to identification and classification of human and natural artifacts . <p> Historic artifacts were identified , labeled , recorded , and separately bagged . All artifacts were separated as lithic ( stone or rock ) , ceramics , bone , and historic ( metal , wood , brick , glass ) . Lithics were separated , weighed , labeled , and bagged . Fine details of pottery fragments were examined , such as the grain size , type of temper , hardness , surface decoration , average thickness , surface and interior colors , and rim type . <p> The Tools We Used <p> Students and adults used simple tools and keen observation skills . Their equipment included shovels , trowels , five-gallon buckets , wheelbarrows , tarps , scale , wire mesh screen , saw horses , graph paper , rulers , plumb bobs , measuring tapes , stakes and string , camera , artifact sizing boxes , classification guides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because several tools required practice for accurate use , students worked beside project leaders to minimize errors of identification and curation . <p> Monitoring and Evaluation <p> All volunteers were monitored by project leaders , professional archaeologists , historians , and **26;4407;TOOLONG . Levels of monitoring included on-site review by team leaders and peers , individual reflection of tasks completed ( Cooper 2002 ) , comparison of results to field guides , and a daily presentation to share discoveries with project leaders and members of other teams . Project leaders ensured that volunteers were hydrated and protected from the elements , and outdoor work was halted in the event of lightning and thunderstorms . <p> Leaders repeated instructions as often as necessary , giving detailed explanations about the importance of protocol and ethical practices . Project leaders and professional archaeologists corrected our errors , a level of careful supervision rarely offered to volunteers in other settings . Team members cooperated , asked questions , and celebrated achievements . The student and adult volunteers became more confident with each day 's efforts and learned to help one another with difficult tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed simple evaluation forms on which they reflected on their experience and offered suggestions to the sponsors for improvement . Each volunteer wrote of expedition highlights , satisfaction with orientation and training , and changes he or she would make as project leader . <p> Outcomes <p> It was challenging to focus our attention on a single plot of earth , five feet wide by five feet long , or to work in a small station within a field laboratory . The hot southeastern summer days and a tropical storm during the Alabama expedition were distractions while in the field . Some of the younger volunteers were unused to long periods of outdoor labor and needed adult encouragement and rest breaks . <p> We uncovered evidence of habitation by early Native Americans at the Virginia and Mississippi sites and remnants of a frontier hotel at the Alabama site . We marveled at simple objects that were crafted six centuries ago -- stone handtools , biface points , and pottery indented with plant material and thumbnail imprints . Alabama team members excitedly shared artifacts of early nineteenth-century frontier life : teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cattle ; Spanish and early American coins ; an intricate compass ; hand-painted porcelain ware ; silverware ; carved and polished oyster shells ; clay marbles ; buttons of brass , bone , and clay ; pipe stems and bowls ; stoneware ink jars ; dark , thick glass bottles ; and wafer-thin window glass . <p> Student and adult volunteers relaxed as they worked , sharing jokes and anecdotes . There was friendly competition between teams trying to find the most surprising artifacts . We shared new discoveries and searched field guides for information about their production and use . Daily team meetings permitted us to share discoveries , ask questions of the experts , record our observations , and view natural history specimens . Conclusion <p> Project sponsors followed the ten principles of good practice for the experiential education archaeology projects ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) , which social studies teachers can apply when selecting local projects for student participation . Participants received many rewards . Recognition by the Forest Service included awarding each participant a patch , button , and PIT Passport to document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the PIT moose logo . The University of Alabama 's recognition packet included a CD-ROM of digital images taken during the field camp , a personal note of thanks , and an invitation from the camp director to return next year . Some students earned high school and college credit through program participation in Alabama and Mississippi . For many , the intangible rewards were the more important ; they had acquired a new sense of kinship with prehistoric and historic residents of the southeast and a deeper understanding of human history . Recreation through active learning had afforded them exceptional opportunities for history to come to life . <p> Outdoor exploration was a healthy alternative to students ' sedentary pursuits on summer vacation . All arose at dawn and worked a full day . Teens and adults were considered equal members of field and laboratory teams , performing the same meaningful tasks . Teenage volunteers gathered and packed supplies . Project sponsors taught them to maintain neat and safe campsites . Each shared in meal preparation . Many seemed to thrive on the increased responsibility and the extra attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adult volunteers . We marveled at how hot summer days passed quickly when we were intensely engaged in the process of discovery . <p> Student and adult volunteers learned to appreciate the tedious and dedicated work of professional archaeologists while honing skills of classification , measurement , and recording artifacts . Several students remarked that experiential education encouraged them to consider archaeology , paleontology , or another field science as potential career choices , which was one of the project 's aims . <p> Friendships were formed with the other volunteers and professional archaeologists as we shared lunch in the field and dinner at the campsite , swapped stories and discoveries , and studied the scientific method and natural history . Volunteers at each site posed for group photos and enjoyed evening games , stories , skits and songs . We found it difficult to leave at the end of each project , and we definitely plan to participate in other field schools . TABLE 1 . Selected State Content Standards by Discipline Compatible with Experiential Learning in Archaeology PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> 
##4002470 Key words : poetry and social justice ; poetry and the social studies ; poetry and cultural diversity <p> As a teacher educator committed to raising issues of racial , economic , and gender equality and those related to an appreciation for diversity , I find poetry to be a powerful resource in social studies methods classes . When preparing preservice teachers for elementary and middle school levels , I find that poetry can often capture their attention and address controversial issues in a meaningful , less-threatening manner . Poets frequently share their personal experiences with cultural diversity , racism , sexism , or classism in short , potent phrases . Poems often affirm women and cultural groups that are less valued in our society , praise individuals who resisted oppression , or portray the harm resulting from prejudicial comments or discriminatory actions . For example , in my social studies methods class , when we read " Harriet Tubman " by Eloise Greenfield ( Hudson 1993 ) , we discuss Tubman 's spirit and courage to resist slavery through her leadership in the Underground Railroad . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma Flor Ada ( Ada 1997 ) , we consider the importance of farm workers who , for little pay and at great personal risk , provide many of our foods . After a decade of using poetry appropriate for children and youth as a social studies resource , I continue to be impressed with how much teacher-education students are moved by poetry when they seem untouched by more objective resources . I hope , of course , that those students will consider the power of poetry when they address multicultural social studies themes in their own classrooms . Achieving the Goals of the Social Studies Methods Course through Poetry <p> As a methods teacher , I emphasize Sleeter and Grant 's ( 1999 ) conception of a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach to social studies . That orientation affirms cultural diversity , fosters equal opportunities , and challenges social stratification . The poems " I , Too , Sing America " and " Merry-Go-Round , " by Langston Hughes , document and challenge racial segregation and inequality during the first half of the twentieth century ( Clinton 1998 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Look Like a Girl ( 1999 ) , by Sheila Hamanaka , affirm children 's cultural diversity and girls ' strength . With a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach in the methods class , I also address such social issues as racism , sexism , and classism ; integrate the experiences and perspectives of women and men from different cultural groups ; include students ' life experiences , especially those that revolve around issues of oppression ; and encourage students to think critically and analyze different perspectives . The poetry in Janet Wong 's Good Luck Gold and Other Poems ( 1994 ) and Jane Medina 's My Name is Jorge : On Both Sides of the River ( 1999 ) provide personal perspectives of racial prejudices , discrimination , and blatant racism . Readers of those poems consider the racism inherent in teasing , stereotyping , and labeling . <p> Another important goal of the course is to encourage preservice teachers to read critically and develop critical literacy . As the teacher , I recognize that my students ' individual experiences , as well as their gender , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other reading and their participation in discussions ( Edelsky 1999 ) . I encourage critical literacy by asking preservice students to consider the social issues in their readings , even if they prefer to ignore them . Although I avoid imposing my own critique ( Edelsky 1999 ) , I select readings , including poetry , that specifically raise those issues and affirm cultural diversity . Poems from Wachale ! Poetry and Prose about Growing Up Latino in America ( Stavans 2001 ) , I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry ( Clinton 1998 ) , Pass It On : African American Poetry for Children ( Hudson 1993 ) , and Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) are excellent catalysts for class discussion of such topics . Why Read Poetry in Elementary Social Studies ? <p> For elementary teachers who must meet the national social studies standards ( National Council for the Social Studies 1994 ) , emphasize literacy within the curriculum , and face limited time for teaching social studies , I recommend poetry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of the ten thematic strands of social studies ( see Vardell 2003 for suggested poems for each thematic strand ) . Teachers committed to a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach may select poems that are not only congruent with this orientation but also address the thematic strands of culture ; time , continuity , and change ; individual development and identity ; individuals , groups , and institutions ; power , authority and governance ; and civic ideals and practices . Teach the Social Studies Standards <p> The poems in Thirteen Moons on Turtle 's Back : A Native American Year of Moons ( 1992 ) , by Joseph Bruchac and Jonathan London , and The Earth Under Sky Bear 's Feet : Native American Poems of the Land ( 1995 ) , by Joseph Bruchac and Thomas Locker , reveal the important similarities and the diversity among Native American cultures . They address the thematic strand of culture by expressing various Native American nations ' beliefs about the natural world . <p> The theme of time , continuity , and change is illustrated in the collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Difference , by Ann Whitford Paul ( 1999 ) . The poems commemorate brave actions taken by fourteen famous and ordinary young women who lived during various eras from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries in the United States . The poems compiled by Lillian Morrison in More Spice Than Sugar : Poems about Feisty Females ( 2001 ) also honor the accomplishments of women in U.S. history , such as Amelia Earhart , Rosa Parks , Sojourner Truth , and Molly Pitcher . <p> The theme of individual development and identity is explored in Francisco X. Alarcn 's bilingual English and Spanish poems in Laughing Tomatoes and Other Spring Poems ( 1997 ) , From the Bellybutton of the Moon and Other Summer Poems ( 1998 ) , and Angels Ride Bikes and Other Fall Poems ( 1999 ) . Alarcn 's poems describe his childhood memories of his family , family activities , their visit to Mexico , and their daily life in Los Angeles as Mexican Americans . The poems in Meet Danitra Brown , by Nikki Grimes ( 1994 ) also address individual development and identity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another when others disparage their skin color , body shape , and eye glasses . <p> The thematic strand of individuals , groups , and institutions is incorporated in the bilingual English and Spanish poems from My Name Is Jorge ( Medina 1999 ) , which describe a Mexican American boy 's struggles in school in the United States . The poems raise awareness of the harmful effects of school on English language learners when teachers mispronounce their names , other students make prejudicial comments about ESL class , and others disparage the students ' first language . <p> With power and authority , poems from Under the Quilt of Night ( Hopkinson 2001 ) illustrate escaping from slavery on the Underground Railroad , the legalized racism inherent in slavery , and the conflicts between slave owners and slaves and the abolitionists who broke the law by helping slaves escape . The poem " Midway , " by Naomi Long Madgett ( Hudson 1993 ) , also depicts a slave 's determination to escape from legalized slavery , and the poem " Harriet Tubman , " by Eloise Greenfield ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commitment to disobey the law and risk her own safety to escape from bondage and lead others to freedom . <p> Poems that illustrate civic ideals and practices include Elegy on the Death of Csar Chvez ( Anaya 2000 ) and I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry ( Clinton 1998 ) . The book-length poem about Csar Chvez treats Chvez 's resistance to injustices endured by farm workers and his efforts to organize migrant farm workers to fight for better conditions . A number of poems from I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry explore the injustice of slavery , legal racial segregation , and racial inequalities in the United States . Langston Hughes 's title poem , " I , Too , Sing America , " and " Merry-Go-Round " are especially powerful in their protest of racial segregation . Use Social Studies Instructional Time Wisely <p> The 2002 No Child Left Behind Act has a negative influence on social studies instruction . As elementary teachers teach the tested subjects of reading and mathematics , attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some elementary and middle school teachers report shortening social studies lessons or integrating reading and writing with social studies ( Editors 2003 ) . Elementary teachers with whom I have contact regularly complain about the lack of time to teach all of the requirements . Poetry can be a valuable teaching tool for helping them solve that problem . Fortunately , reading poetry consumes less time than reading trade books and frequently is more engaging and offers more insight than reading a textbook . Although poetry should remain a supplemental rather than a primary resource for social studies , poetry 's strength lies in its brevity , focus , rich vocabulary , emotion , imagination , and various perspectives ( Vardell 2003 ) . Poetry may show human reactions to historical or current events , historical complexities , and the shared consciousness of an era ( Meadows 1999 ) . Poetry can provide unique insights and descriptions of the world around us , increasing our understanding and awareness of our world ( Donaldson 2001 ) . Carefully selected poems can be read , reread , and discussed during brief instructional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant multicultural , social reconstructionist social studies concepts . Develop Literacy during Social Studies <p> Reading poetry is also appealing to elementary social studies teachers because it promotes literacy , an important life skill for students and one of the tested subjects mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act . Reading poetry aloud provides opportunities for elementary students to read for meaning , discovery , and enjoyment ; develop fluency and expression ; and acquire an appreciation for poetry as they learn about important social studies content . During group discussions about poetry , children practice summarizing important ideas and explaining their interpretation of the poems in light of their own experiences and prior knowledge . Rather than ask students for a " correct " interpretation , the teacher can help students build plausible , personal interpretations of poems related to the social studies topic under study . <p> Elementary teachers may also promote critical literacy by introducing poetry that provides diverse perspectives on social studies topics and raises social issues . They can encourage students to examine poems for their point of view , biases , and issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own interpretations of the poems ' meanings , justify those interpretations , and make connections between the poems and their own lives ( Creighton 1997 ; Edelsky 1999 ) . Teachers may also raise ideas and issues that the students overlook during the group discussion , always allowing for diverse responses to those ideas and issues ( Edelsky 1999 ) . Suggestions for Using Poetry in Social Studies <p> Select Poems Deliberately <p> When selecting poems , I recommend that teachers are careful to meet multicultural and social reconstructionist social studies goals , promote reading skills and critical literacy , and make wise use of instructional time . The most appropriate poems contain accurate historical facts and perspectives , provide authentic voices , are developmentally appropriate for students , and fit classroom time constraints ( Danks 1995 ) . Elementary teachers focusing on diversity among families as a social studies topic may choose " When Annie Was Adopted , " " Half-Whole-Step , " and " My Father " from Fathers , Mothers , Sisters , Brothers : A Collection of Family Poems ( Hoberman 1991 ) and " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) . Those poems illustrate different family structures , including single-parent , adoptive , and blended families . In the bilingual English and Spanish poem " Mi Abuela , " Christina Muniz Mutchler explores traditional and nontraditional roles of mothers and grandmothers . Carmen D. Lucca addresses family structure in " I Helped My Mom Not to Be Late for Work , " part of the collection called Love to Mam : A Tribute to Mothers ( Mora 2001 ) . In Daddy 's Arms I Am Tall : African Americans Celebrating Fathers ( 1997 ) contains poems that portray the various roles and qualities of African American fathers . Delia Spotted Bear , a teenage member of the Crow Nation , illustrates family closeness in her poem " My Family " in Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) . The Way a Door Closes ( Smith 2003 ) contains several poems from the perspective of an older son , addressing the challenges that families face when a parent loses a job . The family portrayed in the poems is a multigenerational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for any family . The poems are brief and portray various perspectives . ( For an annotated bibliography of poetry resources appropriate for teaching about diverse families from different cultures to elementary and middle school social studies students , see my Web site , http : **34;4435;TOOLONG . ) <p> Strategies for Reading Poetry <p> Before reading a poem aloud , the teacher needs to provide students with background information on the poet and the period when the poem was written . Books of poetry often contain brief biographies of the authors , or the book 's publisher may have additional information about the author on its Web site . For more extensive author information , teachers can consult the Academy of American Poets Web site at poets.org or complete an Internet search . When introducing the time period in which the poem was written , I suggest that teachers encourage children to relate the year to themselves and their families and that teachers ask questions such as " How old were you when this poem was written and originally published ? How old were your closest family members ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poem was written ? " With older elementary students , teachers can draw out their background knowledge of the important national , state , and community events of that time period and offer additional information on the historical and social context of the poem . <p> To ensure that all students engage in the poetry exercise , the teacher needs to vary the format for reading aloud ( see Vardell 2003 for descriptions of different methods ) . In my social studies methods class , I read poems aloud to preservice teachers at different times during the semester as a means to introduce or reinforce a topic . We also read poems together , choral fashion , or I divide the class into two large groups , with each group reading alternating stanzas . For large group readings , I usually display the poems through a computerized presentation program . The use of different colors for alternating stanzas helps the groups identify which stanzas to read . The students also read poems with a partner or read individually from a book of poetry . If they read with a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem to the rest of the class . When I ask preservice teachers to read poetry aloud , I allow them to prepare for the reading so that they are comfortable with word pronunciation or the meaning of a word or phrase . <p> Strategies for Discussing Poems <p> After we read a poem aloud , students try to explain the meaning of the poem 's important vocabulary and significant ideas . Because so many preservice teachers have had experiences with giving only the " correct interpretation " of poems and their symbolism , I stress that they are free to offer their own interpretation . To encourage greater participation , I ask them to share their ideas with a partner before offering them to the class . When addressing the issue of inequality and struggles for equality in social studies , I have the students read " I , Too , Sing America " and " Merry-Go-Round , " by Langston Hughes ( Clinton 1998 ) , both of which illustrate racism and racial segregation during the first half of the twentieth century . I encourage students to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sit at the table " in " I , Too , Sing America . " I have them describe the location of the " Jim Crow section " on a merry-go-round , bus , and train in " Merry-Go-Round . " I advise the preservice teachers that they should build on the ideas that the children offer and should add a brief explanation of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation before the 1960s civil rights movement . <p> One can find racial inequality for Native American people portrayed in the poem " Indians , " by Ophelia Rivas , a Tohono O'odham teen , in Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) . After reading the poem aloud , young students need to review their knowledge of Columbus , the Pilgrims , and Vikings and their roles in U.S. history . They also need to explain the meaning of the phrases " we are treated as though we do n't belong here " and " we are treated as though we just got here . " <p> To promote critical literacy and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher can have students offer their interpretations of the poems , the issues or themes raised in them , poetry 's contributions to understanding social studies content , and the connections between the issues in the poems and in the students ' own lives ( Creighton 1997 ; Edelsky 1999 ) . For example , the teacher may select poems that portray women 's challenges to racial and gender inequality -- " Ai n't I a Woman , " by Sojourner Truth , " Harriet Tubman , " by Eloise Greenfield , and " From Elizabeth Blackwell , " by Eve Merriam , which are in More Spice Than Sugar : Poems about Feisty Females ( Morrison 2001 ) . After reading the poems aloud , the children can explain what they learned from the poems and what led to their interpretations . The teacher needs to encourage different explanations and reasoning from the students . Once students express their initial responses to the poems , the teacher can have them focus on the issues raised in the poems and their relevance to social studies and students ' lives . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following questions : <p> What rights were the three women fighting for , and what is their importance ? <p> What did you learn about the issue of equality in the United States ? <p> How do these issues affect your own life ? <p> During the discussion , the teacher may add his or her own ideas , guarding against those ideas receiving more attention than the students ' views . <p> Another aspect of critical literacy is a careful analysis of the poets , including their backgrounds , for writing realistic poetry about the poem 's theme or social issue , the author 's purpose for writing the poetry , and the point of view and biases portrayed in the poem ( Creighton 1997 ) . When we read poems portraying racial stereotypes and discrimination , such as " Waiting at the Railroad Caf , " " Math , " and " Noise " from Good Luck Gold and Other Poems ( Wong 1994 ) , I explain to the preservice students that the author is Janet Wong , whose father immigrated from China and whose mother immigrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Los Angeles . Given that background , I encourage students to question if we can believe that the author is describing real experiences and can explain why Wong might have written about them . We discuss problems of a teacher 's stereotyping students on the basis of race , gender , or family background ; the harm resulting from racial discrimination through teasing ; and strategies for coping with racial discrimination . Finally , I ask the preservice students to identify the author 's perspective and any biases they notice in the poems . Sometimes we address the possible bias against European Americans and the advancement of the status of Chinese-Korean-Americans in some of Wong 's poetry . Conclusion <p> For elementary teachers who have limited time for social studies but must address the national social studies standards and promote their students ' literacy development simultaneously , poetry is a valuable resource . Teachers can read and discuss poems during brief instructional periods , while still engaging children and helping them learn significant social studies content . From my decade of experience reading poetry aloud in my social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preservice teachers and motivates them to think about multicultural , social reconstructionist ideas . They are often surprised that poetry is a credible supplementary social studies resource . Most preservice students appreciate the engaging language , personal tone , and deep emotions found in poetry that are missing from social studies textbooks . Poems make abstract issues of cultural diversity and racial , economic , and gender injustices real . Poetry definitely offers rich learning opportunities . I hope that the poetry read in my methods class will inspire the preservice teachers to address those issues later in their own classrooms and challenge injustices in their daily lives . <p> 
##4002471 Section : CLASSROOM Success Stories <p> Key words : trade books and teaching ; using a trade book to teach geography ; geography for fourth graders <p> Teachers are notorious for purchasing children 's literature . They seek books that entice students into the act of reading , support curricular objectives , and teach civic and moral lessons . Depending how it is used in a particular unit , quality literature can often bring subject areas to life for teachers and students . A book can be a powerful tool that supports learning in many ways . <p> For quite a few years , I conducted an interdisciplinary project called Travelmates with my fourth graders ( McCarty 1993 ) . The Travelmate unit was a way for fourth graders to " see the world " and yet never leave their classroom . Students sent out stuffed animals armed with a classroom pictorial dogtag , a letter of introduction , and a journal to record their traveling adventures . Once the travelmates were out the door , traveling with family members or friends , the fun began for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aruba , Belize , or San Francisco became common activities after mail delivery . Connecting Curriculum through Literature <p> A storybook that I felt would support this project as the Travelmates were touring the world was Anita Lobel 's book called Away from Home ( Lobel 1994 ) . The book has minimal text but is extremely rich with beautiful illustrations and wonderful use of alliteration . Lobel 's alphabet book sat on my shelf for over a year until I was asked to teach a demonstration lesson in social studies with my fourth grade students for a dozen teachers from Poland who were visiting the local university . I thought Ms. Lobel 's book would be perfect because the limited text would make the interpreter 's job less difficult . A description of the book printed in Instructor began as follows : <p> The curtain rises on an international cast of 26 boys , each of whom acts out a city scene against a backdrop depicting a famous sight : David dances in Detroit , Upton unpacks in Uxmal , and Xavier xylophones in Xian . ( Freeman 1993 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the lesson by reading the book . My elementary students and Polish teachers alike laughed at some of the scenes . Our guest teachers even started chattering when they heard " Keith kicks in Krakow " as we progressed through this alliterative-designed alphabet book . The interpreter explained later to the class that the city of Krakow was in Poland and that the scenery depicted on the page of the book was the very beloved centerpiece of the city . All of the teachers from Poland had visited that place at one time in their lives . <p> The lesson proceeded with teams of students and Polish teachers working together , using atlases to locate four or five of the twenty-six cities mentioned . One member of each team came forward to record the location ( state or country ) of the city on a previously prepared transparency with a vertical listing of the alphabet followed by a corresponding city and a blank space on which to write the city 's location . Then another team member located the city on a large world map while the others located the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team was as successful as the student teams in sharing that information orally . Extending Students ' Learning <p> I was pleased with the results of the lesson and congratulated the students for their efforts after the teachers left . I was stunned , however , by what my students said next : " Mrs. McCarty , we have to do more with this book . " <p> I replied in a laughing tone , " Like what ? " I thought the students were going to give me some flippant response that we all might enjoy . <p> " We have to create our own book , just like this author did , " Chris said in a very serious tone . <p> I paused for a moment . I really liked it when my students arrived at the conclusion that they needed to extend their learning . I had often encouraged such student thinking , but I started to ponder the following points : We only have three weeks of school left , and we have many curriculum objectives to complete . Can I really add one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen sometimes with my heart and not my head to students ' requests . I responded after that brief reverie , " What are you thinking ? " <p> The students started chattering away , brainstorming ideas , planning a design , being creative with their ideas . Then a hand shot up . " We ca n't create just one book . We have to make two ! " <p> " Why is that ? " I inquired . <p> " This book located cities around the world . Since we 're in fourth grade and have studied U.S. geography this year , we need to create a book that just features cities in the United States . We need to design this in addition to one that shows cities around the world , like Ms. Lobel 's book , " Domini promptly stated . <p> I had to agree with that thought . I considered how this could pull together some of the learning we had acquired this year . " How could we accomplish two books before school ends ? I do n't want to start this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a class , we decided that we would set aside our Writers ' Workshop stories , which each child was working on , and turn our efforts toward this class writing activity . We took a vote . The response was unanimous . Students knew that as they finished their work on the collective books , they would have time to go back to their other stories that were in various stages in the writing process or could continue to work on them on their own time . With a Plan of Action , Work Begins <p> We now knew the time frame that we had each day to work on the project . Next we needed to determine the design of the two books . After a brief class discussion , the group decided that we would follow the exact alliterative format that Lobel followed in her work . We talked about the meaning of that . Every sentence would need to be structured with a person 's first name , an action verb , and a prepositional phrase that ended with the name of a city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first letter of the proper noun and verb . We practiced with a few names in the class : " Domini dived in Dallas " and " Lauren leaped in Little Rock . " The children were eager to use their own names in designing the book and wanted to write and illustrate the pages containing their names . That would work just fine . <p> Now we needed to determine where we could find assistance to begin the process . We had had some previous practice on word usage , so one of the students said that we would need a thesaurus . Another stated we would need a dictionary . Lauren wanted to know , " How are we going to find these places around the world ? " Then one student reminded everyone , " Remember the atlases we 've been using for Travelmate postcards when they return ? That 's what we can use . " The students thought that was a good idea . <p> From the back of the classroom , Andrew said , " We 're going to need to know something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , so Andrew and a couple friends marched off to the library to ask the librarian to help them find some books on the clothing or architectural designs found in different places around the world . That idea led the class to a discussion about " culture " and how we could represent culture appropriately through our illustrations . <p> We were ready to assign letters of the alphabet to different students so we could begin the production process . We divided the number of pages needed for two books by the number of students and assigned the appropriate number of pages to each person , making sure each had the letter of either his or her first or last name . Among the resources we used to discover more about people , places , and action verbs were books with babies ' names that some children brought to class . From those books , the children found such names as Xerxes , Ursula , Odel , or Zeeman . <p> My job as the facilitator was to design a template for the stage backdrop that would be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We designed it similar to Ms. Lobel 's book , just in a smaller version . We made a dummy copy so that the children could visualize how the final book would appear . Progressing toward Publication <p> In less than two weeks , the class had created exciting sentences by using thesauruses , dictionaries , and atlases . They illustrated and colored their artwork , trying to pay close attention to cultural details in the clothing or architectural designs that were unique to a particular country . We placed the artwork on template sheets designed to create two books . <p> The children worked collaboratively . Some had had more experiences that could help the others make better decisions in their artwork or word choice . The discoveries made during this process were incredible . For example , when Nick was designing the M and N pages in the international book , a classmate whose family had hosted a foreign exchange student from Japan the year before suggested that Nick use the Japanese name " Miura . " Nick liked the name and chose the action verb " married " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft design , he showed Miura in a white wedding gown . A student commented that that was not the outfit that Japanese women wore when they got married . Nick went back to the drawing board and found a book about the Japanese culture that showed a bride in a fancy kimono . His illustrated page had a background map of Japan with a Japanese woman wearing a fancy kimono . His sentence was : " Miura married in Maebashi . " That location is a city in Japan , near Tokyo . <p> The children were creative with their ideas . Brittanie wrote , " Brittanie boxed in Broken Hill . " Because Broken Hill is located in Australia , she drew a picture of herself and a kangaroo with boxing gloves located in a boxing ring ( fig. 1 ) . Another child wrote , " Yolanda yelled in Yorkton . " Because Yorkton is located in Canada , and the students knew that a popular sport in Canada is hockey , the child drew a person dressed in a hockey jersey with skates , hockey stick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler . Stephanie drew a young boy dreaming with a bubble that said , " I wonder ... " and wrote , " Isaac imagined in Iglesias " ( Italy ) . With each of their sentences and illustrations , the children conveyed a unique story . Finishing Details <p> As a group , we decided to make our book as real as possible . We designed a cover page , a copyright page , and a dedication page . We had different committees working separately on each book . Although one book focused on the world and the other on the United States , both committees decided that the title and author credits had to include Ms. Lobel 's name . Each book was called Away from Home II , with author credits given to " Anita Lobel &; the Fourth Grade . " <p> The children liked the information contained on the original copyright page about the watercolor and gouache paints and the Leawood text type . They decided to imitate that format and use the following information on their copyright page : " Colors and markers were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . " They dedicated both books to Anita Lobel and her work on the original book Away from Home and to all the children around the world working toward peace . I thought that was a fitting way for the children to pay tribute to the author 's work . One group also placed their school pictures on the copyright page so that anyone reading the book would know the children who wrote the book . <p> The children needed to add one more page to the books . Ms. Lobel ended her book with an index page that was a quick resource for children trying to locate the cities used in the text . We had compiled similar information for our books as we wrote the text by having each child responsible for his or her respective place . Examples from the index page in the international book include the following information : <p> Asuncion is the capital of Paraguay , a country in South America . <p> Broken Hill is in the country of New South Wales in Australia . <p> Jakarta is a city in Indonesia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greece on the European continent . <p> The U.S. book index seems less exotic , with its more familiar examples such as the following : <p> Iowa City is the old capital of Iowa . <p> Orlando is a city that is growing rapidly and is a popular winter resort in Florida . <p> Portland is located on the northern border of Oregon . ( If you found the Portland in Maine , that 's cool too . ) <p> Quincy is located in Massachusetts near Boston . Conclusion <p> We laminated the pages of both books so that the work could be better preserved . The students were extremely proud of themselves and felt as if they were real authors . Some children asked for a copy of the book that they helped create . I supplied them with black and white copies . Others wanted copies of the dummy draft with text so they could draw their own illustrations over the summer vacation . Because of all their work , I decided that the children deserved a copy of the masterpiece in any form they desired . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children and me . We had become explorers , researchers , adventurers , tourists , and word sleuths . We also became more culturally literate and more aware geographically of what an exciting place the world can be . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 1 .
