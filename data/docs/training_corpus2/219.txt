the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer let's create a wave of donors
