you know i remember watchin the game back in the early summer of 08 and it was just devastating couldn't believe it i was there sittin behind and beside jack and he was just so damn quiet damn quiet and arms folded steaming i mean he was having his usual crackin time at the game but he was beside himself by the time the laker had lost their 24 point lead in the forth quarter lost the lead in their own house their own court jack's own hardwood drinkin bottled water i thought he'd pull his barker out and start shootin up the joint
