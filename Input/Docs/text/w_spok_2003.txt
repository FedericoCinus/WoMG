Correspondent David Piper is live in Baghdad . Hi , David . qwq @ ! DAVID-PIPER-FOX-N : Hi , Judge . Operation Iron Hammer is continuing tonight . There was a number of explosions earlier this evening from the southeast . U.S. military sources are saying they used an AC-130 gunship to actually attack a building , which was firing rockets and missiles in the past against coalition forces . Also in another incident , drivers took shots at a number of forces from 1st Armored . They returned fire , hit the car and also captured three of the assailants . What they 're describing here , the military source says , it 's been a quiet day . And a U.S. military official said earlier they will definitely be more offensive operations to find what he described as the terrorist in their lairs . Yes , the U.S. troops hit a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as insurgents seen firing mortar killing two . Meanwhile , the recent attacks in Baghdad has forced the civil provisional authority to close the July 14 bridge indefinitely . It was re- opened last October with great fanfare , showing , the authority said , the improved security situation here . But now they say it will stay closed until all the insurgents are either killed or captured . In reaction , Japan is saying it 's holding off sending its forces here . South Korea says it 's capped its forces at 3,000 , and Denmark is saying it is not sending anymore for now . Now this has all come about after that deadly explosion in Nasiriya yesterday . The death toll from that has now reached 31 . And also a U.S. soldier was killed yesterday in a roadside explosion . Now all eyes seem to be now turning to the return of U.S. civil administrator Paul Bremer from his talks with President Bush in Washington to try to speed up the transfer of power to the Iraqis . Now back to you , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you go , is there sort of a feeling amongst the provisional authority that power is going to be transferred , sooner rather than later ? qwq @ ! PIPER : There is a confidence that something is in the works at the moment . But really all I can say is it 's a very fluid situation here . Paul Bremer does need to bring something into this situation to really calm the nerves of the Iraqis and to just perhaps to show that this situation is not getting out of control . Because , after all , this was very much a whistle stop tour to Washington , and really there needs to be something coming back from here to really just calm the situation down . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : David Piper in Baghdad . Thank you very much . A push to accelerate plans for an Iraqi constitution is raising some serious questions . Noah Feldman is the author of " After Jihad : America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy . " And that is today 's big question , Professor Feldman . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! NOAH-FELDMAN-AUTH : The bottom line is if the Iraqis wanted to speeds up this process , they definitely could . And , in fact , the members of the governing council would like nothing better than to write an interim constitution , a kind of basic law , to lead up to the general elections . The problem is who runs the country in the meantime until you get a constitution written ? And not surprisingly , the governing council would like it to be the answer to be the governing council . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Now you have been an adviser to Ambassador Paul Bremer on what type of constitution they should have . How are they going to reconcile , say , suppression of women , and Western values , all persons are equal ? qwq @ ! FELDMAN : Well , if they interpreted Islamic values to require putting women in second-class status , then you would n't be able to reconcile them , because one of the basic requirements of democracy is that all people are equal , not matter what their religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that Islam is compatible with true equality and with true liberty , because they do n't think that Islam means putting women second . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : If we take the new Afghan constitution , about which you wrote so eloquently in this morning 's " New York Times " , how does it reconcile Islamic values with Western values ? For example , does n't it proclaim that Islam is the law of the land ? qwq @ ! FELDMAN : Absolutely . Well , it does n't say that Islam is the law of the land , it says that no law can be incompatible with Islam . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Right . qwq @ ! FELDMAN : Which is not exactly the same thing , as you know , Judge , because it means they can pass all kinds of laws as long as they 're consistent with Islam . At the same time , what that constitution does is guarantee that every law passed will be consistent with international human rights standards and with conventions like the international convention on the elimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now who will decide if a law discriminates against women and , therefore , violates Western values or a treaty to which Afghanistan is a party , or if a law follows Islam and , therefore , should remain the law ? Who will make that decision in the new Afghan government ? qwq @ ! FELDMAN : It is going to fall to the Supreme Court of Afghanistan . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : No surprise . The Supreme Court decided what the law is. qwq @ ! FELDMAN : They 're going to have the right to say so . And the question will be who is on that Supreme Court ? Because the constitution says they can either be trained as Islamic legal scholars or as secular legal scholars . And we 'll probably see a mix of Islamic lawyers and ordinary civil lawyers . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Is it likely that we should expect that the new constitution for Iraq will be modeled on the efforts in Afghanistan to blend Islam and Western values ? Will we see a similar document coming out , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELDMAN : The Iraqis are fiercely independent and they insist that they want their constitution not to be modeled on anybody else 's . But what we will see , that I think will be common , is a constitution that specifically guarantees democracy , equality and liberty , and that also respects Islam and probably declares it the official religion of the state of Iraq . I suspect it probably wo n't have a provision saying that no laws can be inconsistent with Islam , though . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : What do we do if we hold an election and the people vote freely , and they vote for a dictatorship that imposes a rigid Islam on them and that has no relationship to Western values and is anti-American ? What do we do , nullify that election ? qwq @ ! FELDMAN : One man , one vote , one time is not democracy . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Yes . qwq @ ! FELDMAN : You have to buy into the idea , if you are going to run in a Democratic election , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there can be guarantees of basic liberties and equalities for people so they can go about changing the law the next time . So if you vote to abolish democracy , I do n't think that counts . And I do n't think we should agree to that . I think what we should say is anyone who embraces the basic principles of democracy can run for office . But if you do n't , sorry you have to apply somewhere else . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : So if there is a vote to abolish democracy , we will nullify that vote and make sure there is another one ? qwq @ ! FELDMAN : I think we would probably be in a position for doing that . But on the bright side , I do n't think there 's any chance in Iraq that that would happen because the Iraqis have real experience in living under dictatorship , and they do n't want a new dictatorship , whether it 's Islamic or some other kind . What they do want is a democracy that is consistent with Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get behind them , because if it does n't work out that way , a lot of people are going to be worse off than they were before . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Got it . Professor Noah Feldman , always a pleasure to have you here . qwq @ ! FELDMAN : Thanks for having me. qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Thank you very much . Coming up on THE BIG STORY , is Saddam Hussein a military genius after all ? Word is the butcher of Baghdad may have planned guerilla-style war all along . And Tinseltown scandalized . Imagine that . Impossible , you say . Who knew what and when about a private eye 's wiretaps on celebrities ' telephones . And wicked , wicked weather coast to coast .

##18764 qwq @ ! GIBSON : Money , money , money . President Bush has just passed the $100 million mark in primary campaign fund-raising . Howard Dean and now John Kerry are going private with theirs . Not to pick on those guys , campaign spending for everyone seems to have gone up exponentially every election . Joining me now to talk about its effects , University of Akron political science professor John Green . The big question , professor , how does all this cash affect the political process now ? qwq @ ! JOHN-GREEN-POLITI : Well , you know , for one thing , it means that the public financing system in presidential primaries has just about collapsed . For about 25 years , we 've had public money in the primaries , and it 's had an effect of creating a lot of diversity and a lot of competition . And as that system collapses and we have the front running candidates raising their own money and really astronomical amounts , I think it reduces the choices that are available to voters in the primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I seem to remember a big screaming match about McCain-Feingold campaign financing reform . It got passed . All of us , us amateurs , us lay people , could breathe easier . Uh-huh . Money was n't going to run the system anymore . What happened ? qwq @ ! GREEN : Well , it 's interesting enough . McCain-Feingold had almost nothing to do with presidential politics , and the impact that it did have was to raise the individual contribution limits from $1,000 to $2,000 . Thus , making it a lot easier to raise large amounts of money . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Well , where is all this money coming from ? Are these great piles of money literally coming from individuals writing $2,000 checks , or is there some Dennis Kozlowski corporation out there that is plunking in $100,000 , $500,000 , $1 million ? qwq @ ! GREEN : Oh , no . Almost all of it 's coming from individual donations , and a lot of it in $1,000 and $2,000 amounts . But some candidates , including President Bush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . $100 , $200 $300 $400 . It is just that they raise it from hundreds of thousands of people . And that 's what adds up to these enormous amounts of money . qwq @ ! GIBSON : What has changed in the way money is raised that these numbers get so big ? I mean , I understand $1,000 to $2,000 , but we 're looking at Howard Dean , and we hear this stuff all the time about how he has changed the way money is raised over the Internet . You can go on there and just put your credit card number in. qwq @ ! GREEN : Absolutely . The Internet has finally come of age . For a number of elections now people have been waiting for this to happen , and Howard Dean has figured out how to make it happen , how to raise literally millions of dollars over the Internet. qwq @ ! GIBSON : How does he do it ? I see this stuff on TV . If I want to buy a device to flip eggs in a frying pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I call a number , and they take my credit card , . Bingo , I got it . Is that how it 's working as simple as that ? It 's plain old television marketing ? qwq @ ! GREEN : A lot of it 's as simple as that . And then also , Governor Dean has been able to tap into groups of individuals who use the Internet . People like meetup.com , moveon.org . These are groups of people you might call Internet groupies . They respond very much to appeals over the Internet. qwq @ ! GIBSON : Professor , the president , as you well know , has the biggest pile of dough at the moment . Does Howard Dean have a chance to catch up with him ? qwq @ ! GREEN : Probably not . I do n't think he can match President Bush dollar-for-dollar . President Bush is one of those amazing fund-raisers . But , you know , Governor Dean can potentially do quite well . Perhaps raise a half or two thirds of what the president has raised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive . qwq @ ! GIBSON : All right , political science Professor John Green , University of Akron . Professor , thank you very much . Appreciate it . qwq @ ! GREEN : You 're welcome . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) qwq @ ! CROWD : We want Dean . We want Dean . We want Dean . We want Dean . We want Dean . qwq @ ! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Governor Howard Dean . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : You may have noticed there are a lot of BMW 's and Volvos out there with Howard Dean bumper stickers on them . And President Bush 's tax cuts may have helped pay for some of those Beamers . Heather Nauert has more on why some liberals may feel torn about next year 's election ? qwq @ ! NAUERT : Well , so far about 100 million households are a little bit richer these days because of the midyear tax cuts . Next year , more than eight million more households will get money back from the government too . Consumer confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels are also improving . Some wealthy Democrats , though , are conflicted about it . Writer Daniel Gross asks in this week 's " Slate " magazine , can you hate Bush but love his tax cuts ? That 's today 's big question . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) qwq @ ! DANIEL-GROSS-WRIT : Perhaps it 's not so much love the Bush tax cuts as enjoy them and benefit from them and , yes , loathe the policies or the president at the same time . I think we see plenty of evidence of that . The end result of the Bush tax cut for people , particularly for high income people , is that they 've gotten a raise . And it 's difficult for some people , a lot of people , to square the notion that the president has essentially given them a raise while he is at the same time pursuing policies , whether it 's on the economy , or trade or Iraq or social questions , that they , you know , viscerally disagree with . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Dan , you are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connecticut , which is one of the wealthier areas of the United States . Do these Democrats that you are talking to that have benefited from the Bush tax cuts admit to enjoying those tax cuts ? qwq @ ! GROSS : I think people would sort of admit to enjoying the fact that they have more income . qwq @ ! NAUERT : What do you think they 're going to end up doing about that ? Will they vote for somebody else once they get into the voting booth , or will they say I kind of like how the economy is going , we 're going to support President Bush anyway ? qwq @ ! GROSS : I think that for many high income Democrats , people like George Soros , who just recently gave $15 million to anti-Bush efforts and has vowed to defeat the president . For very high income Democrats like that , marginal tax rates really do n't make that much of a difference . They do n't wake up in the morning thinking , you know , my life would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of 39 percent . A lot of Republicans believe that if you grab people by their tax returns , their hearts and minds will follow . And that 's doubtlessly true that a lot of people sort of voting their pocket books may consider and say , gee , I 'm paying lower taxes . Therefore , I have higher income . Let 's keep it going . I think for Democrats , in general , and for very high-income Democrats , in particular , they 're more concerned about who Bush is going to name to the Supreme Court , or issues like free trade , or the deficit or whatever going to happen to Social Security ? Economics and your economic value alone does not dictate what you 'll do in the voting booth . qwq @ ! NAUERT : OK . Well , Daniel Gross of " Slate " magazine . " Thank you very much . qwq @ ! GROSS : Thank you . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEOTAPE ) qwq @ ! NAUERT : Now in a recent Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to reduce the budget deficit . Fifty seven percent of people polled said no . And when asked which will be the biggest deciding factor in how they 'll vote in the presidential election , the economy and tax cuts beat out Iraq and the war on terror by more than 2-1 -- John . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Funny , you never see people look at their paychecks . You know , the government did n't take enough money last week . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Very true . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Heather Nauert , thanks very much . We all know where I got that line . Coming up on THE BIG STORY , winter coming in like a lion and caught on tape . Powerful winds , heavy rains bringing death and deconstruction across America , and snow in south-central , believe it or not . Plus , another salvo in the drug war with our neighbors to the north .

##18767 ( NEWS UPDATE ) @(MARKET-UPDATE) qwq @ ! GIBSON : You would think the holiday season would make toy companies cheery , but not necessarily . Senior business correspondent Dagen McDowell has the story of , Toys ' r Us ? qwq @ ! DAGEN-MCDOWELL-FO : Toys r ' Us , yes . They reported quarterly earnings today . They reported a much wider loss than anybody was expecting , brought down their forecast for the full year and announced they are closing over 180 stores , most of which are these Kids r ' Us clothing stores . qwq @ ! GIBSON : But why ? I would think Toys r ' Us would be boffo business this time of year . qwq @ ! MCDOWELL : Usually , their sales do come closer to Christmas . But these toy stores , Toys ' r Us and FAO Schwarz , they 're getting Wal-marted . Wal-mart and these other discounters are just competing on price , slashing prices , making profits up on other items . And it is hard for these toy stores to compete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do ? It is not illegal to be Wal-mart. qwq @ ! MCDOWELL : No , it is not illegal to be Wal-mart , but they have to figure out a way they can compete on price . And Wal-mart started cutting prices on its toys a month earlier this year than they have in the past . What they are going to try and do , Toys r ' Us is close some of these stores and just kind of bring the business down to a manageable size . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Well , can they got get the feds to go after them , FAO Schwarz and Toys ' r Us , say , hey , these guys have got predatory practices and they are trying to put us out of business . And actually they 're doing it ? qwq @ ! MCDOWELL : Well , the government is always hesitant to do that because people love shopping at Wal-mart . And if they 're getting low prices ... qwq @ ! GIBSON : They love low prices . qwq @ ! MCDOWELL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in the way of that . qwq @ ! GIBSON : All right .

Arnold Schwarzenegger now the governor of California . He took the oath of office this morning to become the 38th governor of our country 's largest state . Correspondent Trace Gallagher live on the scene today in Sacramento . Hi , trace . qwq @ ! TRACE-GALLAGHER-F : Hi , John . Yes . No galas , no big celebrations , no time like the present , apparently , for Governor Schwarzenegger because he is working in the building directly behind me . This inaugural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to begin at 11:00 , it did . It was supposed to go 45 minutes . It did . His speech was supposed to go 10 minutes , it went 12 minutes . And they wanted it to be low-key . Instead , the entire world peeked in . Seven hundred journalists from 14 countries , satellite trucks surrounding the capital . A-list celebrities -- Vanessa Williams sang the national anthem . Arnold 's children lead other children in the pledge of allegiance and Maria Shriver spoke . Of course , the highlight of the day was Schwarzenegger 's speech . He said he was moved , humbled and honored to be the governor . He promised to unify the state . He quoted both Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy . And he had a few things on the top of his agenda . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) qwq @ ! SCHWARZENEGGER : With the eyes of the world upon us , we did the dramatic . Now we must put the ranker of the past behind us and do the extraordinary . APPLAUSE qwq @ ! SCHWARZENEGGER : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize I was elected on faith and hope . And I feel a great responsibility not to let the people down . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GALLAGHER : He has also said he will repeal the law that gives driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants . And , of course , tomorrow he will call a special session . Any doubt that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a moderate put to rest . Just look at his administration . He has so far appointed 11 Republicans , four Democrats and two independents . His chief of staff is a conservative Republican , his top adviser , a Democrat liberal , his financial adviser , a conservative Republican , his environmental secretary , a liberal Democrat . John , you 've been in this area many years . You know Sacramento politics . It will get very interesting over the next couple of years . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Yes . There 's some people laying in wait in that capital building behind you there , Trace . Trace Gallagher in Sacramento , Trace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I want to thank her for the love and the strength that she has given me . I want to thank her so much for being the greatest wife and the most spectacular partner . And I know how many votes I got today because of you . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : That is now-Governor Schwarzenegger thanking his wife Maria on Election Day . He says he could n't have done it without her , the same thing many successful men say about their wives . Heather Nauert is here with more on the political power wives . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Hi there , John . Well , Maria Shriver was called the secret weapon on her husband 's campaign . She softened her husband 's image , making him more palatable to the swing voters and , of course , helped get out the vote . Of course , she is not the only woman to have stood firmly behind her man . Joining me now is author David Heymann who 's written about women who stand alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Social Club . " He 's also written extensively about the Kennedys . David , today 's big question is , how much does the governorator owe to his wife Maria Shriver ? qwq @ ! C-DAVID- : Well , it 's strange that he said he was elected on faith and hope . He was elected on faith , hope and Maria Shriver . Maria being a Kennedy , Kennedys originated that whole process of brothers , sisters , parents , aunts , uncles all campaigning on behalf of the candidate as they did in John F. Kennedy 's case in 1960 when he was elected president . qwq @ ! NAUERT : I guess they really know better than any other political family in the country how to take on a scandal , how to handle it and how to make it a plus out of a minus . qwq @ ! HEYMANN : Absolutely . And that was the strength in this election in California . The fact that he was an interview he had given much earlier in his career that talked about orgies and drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with allegations of womanizing etcetera , etcetera . I mean , Maria demonstrate a great deal of thick skinnedness in order to support her man . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Had that scandal not basically haunted him at the very last moment , would as many people have come out in support of her and her husband ? qwq @ ! HEYMANN : I think that had the scandal not occurred , there probably would have been -- you know , he would have won an even larger margin , frankly . The thing is that - look , the Kennedys have been haunted by scandals their entire political careers and so Maria is well schooled in how to deal with this sort of an incident . qwq @ ! NAUERT : What is it about women who stand behind or stand alongside these powerful men that basically helps the men to , I do n't know , achieve their full potential or to go out and really go get ' em ? qwq @ ! HEYMANN : Well , the day is different now than it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex political arena that the candidate is faced with . It takes more than just a single person to win an election . People are no longer voting for simply one person , be it a male or female . They are voting -- it 's almost a family unit that is being issued into office . qwq @ ! NAUERT : So people really have bought into the thing that Clinton used to say , during his first time around , saying you get two for the price of one . qwq @ ! HEYMANN : Hillary Clinton is , you know , as he called her , the co- president and , in fact , now she is a viable political presidential candidate in either 2008 or even 2004 . So , we may see the co-presidential couple back in office . Who knows ? qwq @ ! NAUERT : Now in your book , you spent a lot of time , of course , in Georgetown and you 've written about some very powerful women in the past . What have you found about how much influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powerful husbands ? I know you followed around or have written about Katherine Graham , former publisher of the " Washington Post " and her husband . qwq @ ! HEYMANN : Well , her husband actually died in 1963 , killed himself . Katharine Graham took over the " Washington Post " and " Newsweek " magazine . And we all know the power that she wielded . She brought down Richard Nixon . As a matter of fact , Nixon was so taken aback by the power syndrome of the Georgetown ladies that he said this is a shadowy conspiracy of women . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Did Nixon feel threatened by these women back then ? qwq @ ! HEYMANN : At the beginning , he thought this is not something -- these women are not something that I have to pay attention to . But he soon learned that these women were enormously powerful . By the same token , it was Pamela Harriman , another one of the five , who put in a president . Bill Clinton , when she died in 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , I am here , as president , because of her . She raised $70 million in his behalf . qwq @ ! NAUERT : What about sort of the reverse of that ? The men standing alongside powerful women ? Of course , nowadays , we have many powerful women holding high political office . How important is a male spouse to a female politician now ? qwq @ ! HEYMANN : Well , I think that we see less of that because , you know , the tradition being what it is , we have n't yet reached that point where , you know , men of political spouses are there ready to give up their careers and march alongside their female consorts , their partners . And so -- but that day will come . And I think Bill Clinton is a case in point . I think he is ready to support Hillary . qwq @ ! NAUERT : OK . Thank you very much , David Heymann , for joining us . Good luck with your book . Now , the new first lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inaugural today . She read a poem by author Maya Angelou and she later held the bible as her husband gave the oath of office - John . qwq @ ! GIBSON : All right , Heather Nauert . Heather , thank you very much . Coming up on THE BIG STORY , Rush Limbaugh is back on the air after a stint in rehab . Will his career take a hit ? We will talk with radio talk show host Alan Colmes .

##18768 ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) qwq @ ! RUSH-LIMBAUGH-TAL : Ladies and gentlemen , I know that because of some comments I got , many people feel and think that when you go to a rehabilitation center for addictions or other things that the people in there turn you into a linguine spine liberal and that 's not true . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : That is not true , evidently . Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh back on the air after five weeks in rehab . The conservative , who often lectured against drug abuse and argued that drug crimes should be punished , was addicted to prescription painkillers . Alan Colmes is one of the liberal voices here on Fox News channel . And he also is a radio talk show host with his successful " Fox News Live with Alan Colmes. " qwq @ ! ALAN-COLMES- " HANN : Where you fill in occasionally . qwq @ ! GIBSON : I occasionally do fill in . And , of course , his book " Red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes . qwq @ ! GIBSON : And I actually went ... qwq @ ! COLMES : We were in Dallas over the weekend . You came with a big cowboy hat and showed up at the Dallas event . qwq @ ! GIBSON : I did . Yes . And I put one on your head . Meanwhile , what 's the deal with Rush ? Does he have a credibility problem because of this prescription pain pill problem ? qwq @ ! COLMES : You know , I hope it makes him -- I guess in some quarters he would . But as a liberal who preaches compassionate -- we do n't have to put the word compassion before the word liberal , it is built . We favor treatment rather than jail time , so why should I feel differently about Rush Limbaugh ? I hope he gets well , he sounds well . It is going to be a tough road . I do n't know , can 30 days really do it ? qwq @ ! GIBSON : There 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other is whatever jeopardy he may still face from the whole thing of getting the pills over the years . qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes , the legal issue , who knows what more information will come out . But I think this will make him a better broadcaster , perhaps a more nuanced broadcaster , maybe it will change his views on a couple of things . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Do you think he might be a little more understanding of drug treatment centers. qwq @ ! COLMES : Not exactly a linguine-spined liberal as he points out . But he might understand that those who he has criticized in the past they are addicted to something that affects all strata of society . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Listen , I know that while you are a self-identified liberal qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes and proud of it . qwq @ ! GIBSON : And proud of it . Liberals are going after Rush Limbaugh. qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes . Like liberals go after me . My harshest critics are liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend people like Rush Limbaugh . I do n't like the piling on effect . I did n't like it when they piled on to Bill Clinton or Trent Lott . You know , Limbaugh , he has acknowledged that he has got a problem . He is trying to get some help for it . We do n't need to pile on the guy . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Right . But they 're going to . qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes . qwq @ ! GIBSON : And they 're going to say , look , this guy 's got a double standard . Right ? Tell me what they are going to say . qwq @ ! COLMES : Well , they are going to say - they will call him a hypocrite . They will say , look , he preached one thing but did something else . I think it is hard when you are someone who is a broadcaster who takes a righteous stand , a moralistic stand and that is your message , and you convey that message to other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . Again , I think this will make Rush a better person and a better broadcaster and humanize him . I do n't think it is going to hurt him with his audience . I think they will stick with him . qwq @ ! GIBSON : The 20 million will ? That 's a big audience . qwq @ ! COLMES : Most . They did a survey , maybe 8 percent . He 'll get a new audience . I think he 'll attract new people , probably more people tuned in today than ever before . And I think there will be a curiosity factor . And he will retain a large part of this audience . He is a great broadcaster . What people understand about Rush Limbaugh is he is an entertainer , he is not a politician . He is not making policy . He entertains people . And this is part of that whole entertainment genre . So , people get that about him . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Well , OK . Now let 's just say for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limbaugh on his first day back . qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes . qwq @ ! GIBSON : And you said , look , you have to face this issue . You have hammered people about , you know , going to jail for drug offenses . So , how are you going to deal with that ? qwq @ ! COLMES : I think as he did today . He talked about it . He promised -- he did a great tease . This is a great broadcaster . We do it in this business all the time , the great tease . " I 'm going to talk more about this my friends , in the days to come . " It just keeps them tuning in . They want to hear those little morsels . In the natural course of conversation this will come up . qwq @ ! GIBSON : And not everything you read in the " National Enquirer " was true . qwq @ ! COLMES : Right , exactly . I 'm sure that it was he said . I did hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people now want to tune in every day to see what more now can I glean ? He did n't want to give everything away the first day . qwq @ ! GIBSON : He said also that he had butterflies in his stomach about coming and doing this first show in a while . You know , as somebody who 's sat in that chair , why would that be ? qwq @ ! COLMES : I get butterflies coming here to talk to you . You get butterflies every day in this business , I think . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Look , there is you on the air . qwq @ ! COLMES : Yes . It 's amazing . Wow . If you 're gone for a while , and especially you have to come back and you have got to say something . He knew he had to address it . I mean , he knew he had to address it in a way that was credible , that gave him additional credibility . Of course , he 's going to have butterflies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . qwq @ ! GIBSON : So do you think that those people who are self-identified liberals who want more money spent for drug treatment , for instance , might want to go embrace Rush Limbaugh and try to bring him to their sides of things . qwq @ ! COLMES : Well , if they were smart , they 'd work on him and say , look , I think the whole war on drugs is ridiculous . I think we should decriminalize them . Libertarians I think have it right . The war on drugs is a failure . It is a never ending war that is never going to end . Gary Johnson , former governor of New Mexico who wanted to decriminalization , I think he was a Republican , but libertarian on that , I think had it right . Until we really address the drug issue in this country intelligently and realize that what we are doing now is n't working , we are not going to win the war on drugs . qwq @ ! GIBSON : But the war on chronic pain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look , he has a lot to deal with . I only wish him well . A good liberal would wish him God speed and a speedy recovery . qwq @ !

Rush Limbaugh out of rehab , back on the job , full of wisdom and talking cold Turkey . But now live from New York , John Gibson . qwq @ ! JOHN-GIBSON-HOST : Hi , everybody . President Bush does n't arrive in London until tomorrow , but Scotland Yard is already on high alert with security , the likes of which has not been seen since the IRA terrorized London in the 1970 's . Sky news correspondent Jane Secker outside Buckingham Palace . qwq @ ! JANE-SECKER-SKY-N : Well , it means a heck of a lot of security , that 's what it means . We know that there are 14,000 police officers going to be on duty during the time that the president 's here . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is half of all the metropolitan police , half of all London police officers will be working , all leave , of course , canceled . And it will also be the security that the president brings with himself , including 250 people who are armed . We know there is going to be a ring of steel around the president so people are n't able to get close to him . But at the same time , the demonstrations that are planned for London have been told they can go ahead . And the demonstrators here have got their own way , and they 're able to walk down Whitehall , a key street close to the heart of the government . The police wanted to stop from doing that because they thought it could be a security threat . But this afternoon , they managed to reach an agreement and the demonstrators are going to be able to get pretty close to the president . I think it is fair to say that he is going to be able to get the message from a large number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to see him in the country . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Jane , what about this -- you mentioned 250 armed officers coming with the president . And some dispute about whether they are actually empowered to shoot anybody that poses some sort of threat or does something threatening . What has that squabble been about ? qwq @ ! SECKER : Well , it 's funny . There has been a joke doing the rounds here that 250 Americans , with freedom to use their guns in London without a license is n't something that particularly impresses many Londoners with America 's friendly fire record . But in all seriousness , I think people are aware that the president is going to need security . There has been a heightened level of alert here in London . It 's gone up to the second highest level that . That we 're told is because of a separate al Qaeda threat . It is not meant to be related to the president coming . But it is hard to believe , of course , that if the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would n't be a much higher security risk . So I think people here are really taking no chances . At Buckingham Palace itself , there were requests from the president 's entourage to reinforce the room he was staying in , including the glass and the curtains . But apparently , the Queen said no . She said if it 's good enough for me to live here , it should be good enough for you to visit . And she did n't want the fixtures ripped out , damaging the palace . Also in the palace , people will be wearing security badges for the first time . We understand that the Queen herself wo n't have to wear one , but pretty much everyone else who is going in and out of Buckingham Palace over the next few days is going to be screened , everything going in is going to be screened for bombs and things like that . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Jane Secker in London , Jane , thank you very much . And from the beginning , Prime Minister Blair 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But President Bush 's visit is putting Tony Blair in an awkward position . The anti-war crowd will be venting their anger long after the president is gone . Peter Riddell is the author of " Hug Them Close " and chief political commentator for the " Times " of London . Earlier , I asked him , how much do the British people hate President Bush ? And that 's today 's big question . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) qwq @ ! PETER-RIDDELL-CHI : I do n't think they hate him so much as they 're rather puzzled by him . The Texan style as well as the policies adopted since he became president , particularly of Iraq , confuse people in Britain . There was a lot of hostility towards the war and they blame George Bush . And the way he talks does n't go down very well in Britain . qwq @ ! GIBSON : What do you mean by the way he talks ? qwq @ ! RIDDELL : Well , the very Texan language , the talking of folks , the approach to things , which does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rest of the world , appears incomprehensible . It was partly true with Ronald Reagan . Ronald Reagan had much more charm . People forgave Ronald Reagan in Britain , even though they did n't understand him . There is an enormous gap between Britain and Texas and Britain and California . Part of the matter is a failure to understand . I lived in the U.S. for several years so I understand where George W. comes from and very different roots from his father . One understands that , but most British people don't. qwq @ ! GIBSON : So what is it about Bush , in particular , that has the British people so riled up ? qwq @ ! RIDDELL : Well , one , they did n't feel there was a full justification - - a majority of them did n't feel the full justification of going to war with Iraq as opposed to carrying with the policy of containment . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Before there was even a proposal to change the regime in Iraq , Gerhard Schroeder in Germany said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French would n't participate . If all of those people that you would draw into a coalition are stamping their feet and saying no , what is he to do ? qwq @ ! RIDDELL : Tony Blair believed that the real danger was one that America should not be left alone , that other countries should work with America , particularly after 9/11 . And Tony Blair understood that very quickly . And secondly , there was a danger that weapons of mass destruction would get into the hands of terrorist groups . That 's really his fear . The problem is not finding any WMD since the war has undermined support for the war in Britain , and that 's created some of the hostility to George Bush and his visit to Britain . There are contradictions . I agree . There a tiny minority of idiots with no sympathy with Saddam . There is a feeling of why now ? Why have to act now ? qwq @ ! GIBSON : Now how badly does this hurt Tony Blair , his friendship with America , his friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you have to draw a distinction there . The British public is not anti-American at all . Indeed , we are more pro-American than any other country in Europe . There is a distinction between America and George Bush . And it 's very interesting that by quite big margins , much like the Canadians or the Australians , we 're pro-American - critical of British public of George W. In terms of damage to Tony Blair , he 's adopted what I call in my new book hug-them-close approach . And that 's what one of Tony Blair 's advisers described to me as the Blair tactic , which is get inside the Oval Office , argue with George Bush , and Condi Rice , and Dick Cheney , and Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld in private , but very strongly support him in public to show you are the ally and try to get private influence . That 's his tactic . It is very difficult to show results from that and that is why he is in trouble . Now one should n't overrate the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservatives in the opinion polls . Everyone still expects him to be prime minister when we have our next election in two or three years ' time . But , nonetheless , there has been damage . The feeling he is too close to George W. And there 's been an undermining of trust in him . qwq @ ! GIBSON : There is some discussions that maybe George W. can actually charm the British people on this trip . Do you think that 's even possible ? qwq @ ! RIDDELL : I think what he 's got to be careful to do , and we 're seeing this in the previsit interviews is be too effusive . He did one with David Frost and he has done some press interviews . He has really talked so highly of Tony Blair , his friend , his ally and so on . Sometimes the British public do n't like too much flattery . They do n't like too much praise . They 'd rather like perhaps a more detached view . We 're a bit different from the Americans . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want too much praise . And , therefore , there is a slight embarrassment factor if the president talks too warmly about the prime minister . What he can do is be open , be direct , and he has been in some interviews . Look , here 's what we are trying to do in Iraq . And on that , he has strong support from a lot of people , including myself . He has to finish the job . There , if he emphasizes that , he 'll get more sympathy and support here . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Who , in fact , is a bigger hawk Tony Blair or George W. Bush ? qwq @ ! RIDDELL : Interestingly enough , before 9/11 , it was probably Tony Blair . George Bush was a midget before 9/11 . HE was merely thinking of smart sanctions against Saddam . It was Tony Blair who was saying we have a problem here , we have to deal with it . So I would n't say who 's a hawk now . They both agree they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and get international support for the other problems , like Iran , where Britain is working very closely with France and Germany to try and persuade Iran to back down on the nuclear program . So I think what Tony Blair is saying is try and get other countries to go with you . It may be easier , actually , on Iran than Iraq , curiously . I do n't think you can say which is a greater hawk . Tony Blair is aware of the rest of the world a bit more . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Mr. Riddell , thank you very much . Appreciate it . qwq @ ! RIDDELL : A pleasure . qwq @ !

##18772 ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) qwq @ ! GEORGE-W-BUSH-PRE : Glad to be going to a free country where people are allowed to protest . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : Stakes are high for President Bush . His trip to Britain was supposed to be a victorious visit to our most important ally . Instead , he is walking into a lion 's den , highlighting divisions over the war in Iraq . Dr. Nile Gardiner is an international security analyst and was an adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Today 's big question , Mr. Gardner , is this the right time for President Bush to visit the U.K. ? qwq @ ! NILE-GARDINER-INT : I think it is . It is a superb opportunity for President Bush , for Prime Minister Blair to jointly show tremendous leadership on the world stage . I think that there is a lot of doubt and hesitation internationally about what is happening in Iraq . This is a superb opportunity for the billions watching on television worldwide to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of the U.S.-British record in Iraq . And I think also it is an important opportunity to remind the people of Europe that Britain and America , these two great nations together , liberated the people of Iraq . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Well , OK . I buy that . But 30 percent-plus of the British public do n't . And the worldwide television coverage is going to show all these protesters . And every time somebody gets a microphone stuck in their face , they 're going to say no WMD , Blair lied , Bush lied . That ca n't be good for these two . qwq @ ! GARDINER : Well , I think ironically the protests may actually help President Bush domestically . Certainly images of violent left-wing extremists spewing out anti-American hatred , I think these sorts of images will only strengthen the president 's position back home with the American people rallying behind the president . Let 's not forget these protesters do not represent the British public . For example , an opinion poll in today 's " Guardian " newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president 's visit and a majority of Britons support the U.S.- British position in Iraq . Two-thirds of the British public are opposed to withdrawing U.S. and British forces from Iraq . Sixty two percent of the British public believe that America is a tremendous force for good in the world , compared to just 15 percent who believe that American foreign policy is bad for the world . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Dr. Gardner , I understand . You 're preaching to the choir . But a 30 percent minority , a 35 percent minority is a big and loud minority . Was there any way that Bush and Blair could have said , you know , it is just not the right time for him to come visit Britain . Let 's do this another day . qwq @ ! GARDINER : I do n't think so . I think that this is an opportunity for President Bush to get his message over directly to the British public . I think the British public will warm to the president . He is a very likable personality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GIBSON : Well , he is a likable personality , especially to Americans , a lot of Americans . But the Brits are particularly put off by his Texanness . And they talk about it all the time . They do n't like the way he walks , they do n't like the way he talks , they do n't like his expressions . They are offended about Texas in general , death penalty , guns and all . Is he really going to be able to charm them ? qwq @ ! GARDINER : I think he can . Look at the latest opinion poll in Britain on the death penalty , which showed something like 65 percent of Britons supporting the introduction of the death penalty there , a higher figure than exists in the United States . Actually , I think that President Bush shares a lot of common values with the British people . I think the British public , given the opportunity , will take a shine to the president . Let 's see what happens over the next three or four days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I 'm buying your scenario . How will we know it ? With all the people who just are so angry with what America 's war policy , with America as they see it dragging Tony Blair along , dragging Britain along in this , even though they did n't want to go , how will we know that the British public is actually taking a shine to Mr. Bush ? qwq @ ! GARDINER : Well , I think only time will tell . We 'll have to look at the polls , perhaps in the next few days or so to see the long-term impact here . But it 's important to bear in mind in these demonstrators are not only anti-American , they 're also very anti-British as well . They are totally opposed to the monarchy . They are against most aspects of British foreign policy . They are very anti-establishment . They have used extreme violence in the past against British institutions in London . So , this is not just a protest against the United States against President Bush . This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GIBSON : You know , Dr. Gardner , I have to ask you before we run out of time , the very left wing , very anti-war " Guardian " newspaper ran this poll today , as you said , commissioned the poll and ran the results which showed , by far , a majority of Britons support the president , support the war , support what Blair and Bush did together . It must have choked them to print that poll . qwq @ ! GARDINER : Well , I think this was as humiliating poll for the anti-war movement in Britain , because it showed very clearly that a pro-war approach or a position totally in favor of the U.S.-British position in Iraq has increased by something like 12 percentage points just in the past month or so . That is a striking figure and the anti-war critics certainly have no answer to this at all . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Dr. Nile Gardiner , Dr. Gardiner , thank you very much . Good to talk to you . qwq @ ! GARDINER : Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIG STORY , a look at the U.S.-led occupation in Iraq . We 'll talk to someone who says the Iraqis do n't care who 's running their country .

And a landmark ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Court concerning same-sex marriages -- Judge . What happened ? qwq @ !

##18774 JOHN qwq @ ! GIBSON , HOST : This is a Fox News Alert . I 'm John Gibson . Bad news for the king of pop . Michael Jackson 's Neverland Ranch now swarming with police . A criminal investigation underway . Police searching the superstar 's ranch . Trace Gallagher there live , the Santa Ynez Valley and the Neverland Ranch . Hi , Trace . qwq @ ! TRACE-GALLAGHER-F : Hi , John . We 're at the front gate of Michael Jackson 's Neverland Ranch . You can see some deputies are milling around behind the gate there . The property itself is set back quite a ways . Sheriff 's deputies -- we had gotten some aerial video all day long today . but at 8:30 this morning , 20 investigators from the Santa Barbara County sheriff 's office raided this house along with the DA . His name is Thomas Sneddon . It could take several hours to get the investigation going . There was also a crime scene unit up there . They put a port-a-potty up there . This thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ongoing investigation . Reportedly , a 13-year-old boy accusing Michael Jackson of sexual misconduct . We do n't know exactly when it happened or where . But we do know that Michael Jackson right now is not at the property . His publicist saying that for the past three weeks , he has been in Las Vegas shooting a music video and his children are with him . The DA , Thomas Sneddon , going very meticulously about this investigation . He plans on crossing every t and dotting every i . You 'll recall this is very reminiscent of a case 10 years ago . Michael Jackson then accused by another 13-year-old boy of sexual misconduct that lasted some four months . That investigation lasted six months . It subsequently led to two grand juries . But no charges were filed because the child would not testify . The case was settled . Estimated to be somewhere between $15 million and $24 million . There was also a confidentiality agreement signed by both parties . Again , investigators are on the scene right now . Michael Jackson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is in jeopardy , being arrested . But sources tell us if he was here this morning , John , when this went down , he would have been taken in -- John . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Hey , Trace , before I let you go , Tom Sneddon has been the DA there for many years , I think going on 20 years now . He has been through all of Michael Jackson 's troubles , including the recent video of Michael dangling a baby over a balcony and people calling into question his fitness to be a parent . Any indication of why Sneddon has never moved before and why now ? qwq @ ! GALLAGHER : Well , I think he moved before John , but he said a lot of things got in the way , most prominently the 13-year-old boy who would n't testify . You know Sneddon has nine children . He is adamantly in favor of any kind of child abuse -- against any kind of child abuse and is prosecuting these things to the full extent of the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meticulously . He 'll take his time in this case . We do n't know if Jackson will be imminently arrested . Remember , the last case took six months . It happened in August . The grand jury convened in January . One in Los Angeles , another one in February in Santa Barbara County and , ultimately , no charges were filed because they did not have the key witness to go against Jackson . This time , Sneddon apparently believes he has a much better case and will go about it much more thoroughly -- John ? qwq @ ! GIBSON : Trace Gallagher in the Santa Ynez Valley . Tom Sneddon a very tough guy . We 'll see what happens . Trace , thanks a lot . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) qwq @ ! MICHAEL-JACKSON-S : Why would I put my private , private home movies on television . Well , I thought it was time to do so because many people have opinions about me . And they have n't even met me . They do n't even know me . So , I thought it was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . I am simply Michael Jackson . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : Well , a little more to it than that . That is Michael Jackson introducing some home videos he made available to Fox TV in rebuttal to a controversial documentary , which focuses on -- or focused on his relationship with children . In that documentary , Michael Jackson had said he sees no problem with sleeping with children , although he did n't go so far as to admit to having sex with them . Michael Bryant is a correspondent for Extra TV . Today 's big question , Mr. Bryant , what are police likely to find when they search the Neverland Ranch ? qwq @ ! MICHAEL-BRYANT-CO : Well , I can tell you what we believe they 're looking for based on sources that I 've talked to , and that is computer hardware , software , and videotapes . And these are the kinds of things that you would expect to be searched for with the allegations that we think are coming out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken some news on this . You discovered what is the key fact so far in this . That a young boy , I guess 12 or 13 years old , walked into some lawyer 's office and said that something had happened , which led to this . What did you discover ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : Well , that 's the basic crux of the information . A 12-year- old boy at the time went to an LA law firm seeking representation with his parents , alleging sexual misconduct against Mr. Jackson . The attorney and attorneys involved talked to the boy , talked to the parents , chose not to pursue the case , but did point the family in the direction of the DA 's office . I ca n't tell you which County DA 's office because my source was unwilling to say . qwq @ ! GIBSON : So it is not necessarily ... qwq @ ! BRYANT : So I am going to make it very clear ... qwq @ ! GIBSON : It 's not necessarily Santa Barbara County . qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make very clear . We 're not making that -- that 's right . And we 're not sure at this point if there is that connection now . The reasonable inference is there , but connecting those two dots at this point is a little bit premature . We just know that another boy that seems to match the age and description of the one involved in the basis for this search warrant was looking for legal representation , a matter of a few months ago . qwq @ ! GIBSON : So , it is possible that Santa Barbara district attorney Tom Sneddon is conducting a search warrant , executing a search warrant on behalf of another prosecutor ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : That is possible or it 's possible as well that the proposed client was from this area and just sought out an attorney with , you know , a reputation or a bigger office than you might find in the local area here . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Michael , does that suggest that the -- that the hypothetical or perspective victim or alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other remedy than a criminal charge ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : Well , I mean , that 's rank speculation . But since we 're doing that , I think everybody knows what happened in that case 10 years ago , a huge sum of money , whether it is $15 million or $24 million , it changed hands . And then there was no subsequent criminal prosecution . Whether a child and/or his parents are savvy enough or interested in that type of resolution above and beyond a criminal resolution , like I said , it is rank speculation , but it is out there . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Michael , you know , Michael Jackson is obviously a famous guy , a lot of money . He 's had this situation occur in the past . Is it -- is it fair or is it right to hold out the possibility that he is simply being targeted because of his history and because of his wealth ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : Sure . I mean , we see that all the time in celebrity cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celebrity Justice . It is always a possibility . But I do n't know if you get a search warrant and bring the manpower out to this location that we see today . We 've heard 20 people , we 've heard 40 people , I 've heard 60 to 70 sheriff 's personnel and DA personnel . That 's got to be most of the county personnel in that arena . I do n't know if you devote those kinds of resources unless you feel there is some reasonable basis for the allegation . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Right . I was going to get to that . Sneddon has a reputation of being a tough guy , and being a conservative guy and not going off on wild goose chases . Just the fact that he has finally moved in such a way after years of a lot of people asking why he is n't moving , suggested he had some information that justifies. qwq @ ! BRYANT : That is a good inference and I 've talked to the sheriff 's deputies about it , the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't even confirm whether this is an ongoing investigation from some time ago , whether it is a new investigation or whether Mr. Jackson is the target of the bigger investigation or maybe just a corollary side issue relating to some other investigation . qwq @ ! GIBSON : But Michael , the fact that they show up with a number of people , we 're not sure if it is 20 or 40 , but it is a number and they bring a port-a-potty with them , indicates they are going to be there for a while and it is a search that is beyond the ordinary in terms of thoroughness and time . qwq @ ! BRYANT : Well , part of that , of course , if I go somewhere that long , I 'm bringing my own port-a-potty , too . But we 're talking about a huge area here that will take some time to search . Unless they 're looking for elephants , zebras and giraffes , which are probably easier to final , it is going to take a while to go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videotapes . And we 're talking small items and this is a huge operation here . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Michael , you are a lawyer . Michael Jackson in Vegas , which is , of course , another state , is he under some obligation to return to talk to Mr. Sneddon right now ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : No , not at this point . As I understand it , there is not an arrest warrant out for him . That does n't mean he would n't have been taken in to be questioned . But in the absence of an arrest warrant , it is unlikely he 's violated any specific laws regarding his jurisdiction or whether he should be in custody at this time , anyway . qwq @ ! GIBSON : What do you know about what he is doing in Vegas , anything ? qwq @ ! BRYANT : Well , supposedly I think it is a music video or show he is doing at CBS that is going to air next Thursday , at least at this moment it is set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who knows ? qwq @ ! GIBSON : Michael , what is going on at the scene there ? I would imagine there is a fair number of TV reporters and satellite trucks as well as ... qwq @ ! BRYANT : Probably one or two . qwq @ ! GIBSON : ... as well as a gazillion cops . qwq @ ! BRYANT : And it 's the usual set up that you find in a situation like this . It is everybody waiting to see what is going to happen . We 've been told it could take and is expected to take all day for the search to take place . Well , we were also told it could end earlier than that . So here we are , you know , later part of the afternoon , maybe two or three hours left into what would be a business day . I would expect everyone here is waiting for the caravan of vehicles to leave the property . qwq @ ! GIBSON : All right . qwq @ ! BRYANT : And hopefully get some clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GIBSON : Michael , thank you very much . Of course , all this went down in the first place about 10 years ago . Now a repeat . You can see Michael Bryant 's full report on the Michael Jackson police search on Extra tonight at 7:00 p.m. in your local market . And coming up on THE BIG STORY , Bush , Blair , the summit in the U.K. What do the president and the prime minister have to give and get ? qwq @ ! HEATHER-NAUERT-FO : And his story inspired a Hollywood blockbuster . Now the man behind the movie " Born on the Fourth of July " has a new protest on his mind and he is in the U.K. to lead the charge . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Plus , no fancy production . It is just the way the Beatles wanted it -- naked for the world to hear . @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) qwq @ ! END-# 
##18775 ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) qwq @ ! RON-KOVIC-VIETNAM : What is happening in Iraq right now is a mirror image of the nightmare of Vietnam . And it is all happening again . And it is a travesty . qwq @ ( qwq @ ! END-VIDEO-CLIP ) qwq @ ! GIBSON : That is the nightmare of Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic . He is in Britain protesting against President Bush . Heather Nauert has more on Kovic 's crusade -- Heather . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Hi , John . Well , you may remember Ron Kovic from the 1989 film " Born on the Fourth of July , " which is based on his post-war experiences . This time , the former U.S. Marine and Vietnam veteran is leading the protest against President Bush 's trip to London . So , what 's he hoping to accomplish there in London ? Joining me from Chicago is Loretta Smith who has known Ron Kovic for almost 30 years and is working on a film about his life . Loretta , today 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? qwq @ ! LORETTA-SMITH-FIL : Hello , Heather . I think Ron went over there on a personal mission to build a bridge between the people of the United States and the people of Europe . As you know , people all over Europe are enraged by the unilateral war that the United States has waged in Iraq . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Loretta , let me stop you there real quick . We have an alliance , of course , with Britain and they have been the U.S. 's biggest backers really in Iraq . So there is a bridge there of sorts already . One of the things that Ron went over there to do is essentially , as I understand it , to deliver a petition to Tony Blair saying President Bush should n't come to the U.K. , should n't come to the U.K. to meet with Tony Blair about the future of Iraq . So , what 's he trying to do to that bridge that you mentioned ? qwq @ ! SMITH : Well , that -- the petition that he delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioning their government to rescind the invitation to George Bush , because the Britons do n't want to create the impression that the British public supports the unilateral action that our country waged in Iraq . So , Ron was just building a bridge to the peace movement in the U.K. by personally going over there to deliver the petition . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Now is it possible that some of these groups who really define their mission as bringing down Tony Blair , running Tony Blair out of office and , of course , embarrassing President George Bush at this time , is n't it possible that those groups are just using him to try to get accomplished what had they want to get accomplished ? Tony Blair out of office . qwq @ ! SMITH : Well , I think Ron would tell you that he was used 35 years ago when he went to Vietnam to fight an unjust , immoral war . And I think he learned a lesson from that . And for the past 35 years , he has been trying to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I do n't think Ron is being used . I think he has applauded the peace movement in Europe . Back in March , before the U.S. invasion , a million people were marching in London to protest the war , and Ron was just very enthusiastic about that . qwq @ ! NAUERT : What would it actually take for Ron to support -- of course , Ron was paralyzed fighting in Vietnam on his second tour of duty , if I recall correctly . qwq @ ! SMITH : Yes . qwq @ ! NAUERT : But at what point would he actually agree that the U.S. or any other country for that matter should go to war ? As I understand it , he did n't support our efforts in Afghanistan after 9/11. qwq @ ! SMITH : Well , I think Ron , like many people in this country and around the world , feels that war should be used as a very last resort and it should be not -- it should not be engaged in unilaterally by one country who has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tough one . 9/11 in particular , and I know Ron is from the New York city area , to not support going to war after 9/11 , when on earth can you go to war ? qwq @ ! SMITH : But why Afghanistan ? The people who flew those planes into the buildings were from Saudi Arabia and Yemen . They were n't from Afghanistan . qwq @ ! NAUERT : Would he support going to war on Saudi Arabia ? qwq @ ! SMITH : Well , why war ? Why ca n't we negotiate with people and urge a regime change in Saudi Arabia instead of the corrupt dictatorship that we 've supported for all these years ? Why not encourage the people to install a Democratic regime in Saudi Arabia ? You know , the idea of democracy in the Middle East is certainly an idea that Ron endorses , but he does n't think that the United States should be going around the world starting wars with people who have n't done anything to us. qwq @ ! NAUERT : All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary about his life . Good luck to you on that . qwq @ ! SMITH : Thank you very much . qwq @ ! NAUERT : And we 'll look forward to hearing about that later . Now despite concerns about the anti-war protesters might get out of hand there in London and that violent demonstrators might join them , Prime Minister Tony Blair insists that the U.K. will stand firm and see the war on terror on through to the end . qwq @ ! GIBSON : All right , Heather , I hope Loretta puts in her movie that the Taliban and al Qaeda were in Afghanistan . And that 's why we went there . Heather Nauert , thanks very much . Massachusetts could become the first state to issue marriage licenses to gay couples . And the state 's highest court rules same-sex couples must be allowed to legally wed . The Massachusetts legislature could change the state 's constitution to ban gay marriage . Here to explain the ruling and what might happen next Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano . So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Well , it was n't quite that simple . The court said that the legislature must decide if it 's going to allow civil unions or gay marriages . But the legislature can not ban some type of state-recognized union between same-sex couples because the constitution would prohibit -- the constitution of the state of Massachusetts would prohibit such a ban . So , the legislature does not have a full panoply of choices before it . qwq @ ! GIBSON : But did it say that the state legislature must -- must allow same-sex couples to be married or did it say something else , one of these Vermont union things is possible ? qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : Well , that 's a very good question , because it cobbles together phrases with which we 're familiar . We 're familiar with the phrase civil union because that 's what they call it in Vermont . We 're all , of course , familiar with the word " marriage . " The Supreme Court of Massachusetts today called it civil marriage , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it basically told the legislature , whatever you do , and you only have six months in which to do it , you must provide for the recognition of a stable , committed union between persons of the same sex , whatever you want to call it . qwq @ ! GIBSON : OK , now is the basis of this that same-sex couples do n't have the same legal rights as married couples ? Or was the basis of it sort of an abstract , hey , look , if you are in love , you ought to be able to get married ? qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : The basis of it was the constitution of the state of Massachusetts does not let the legislature distinguish between heterosexual couples and same-sex couples . And if you are going to grant the benefits of marriage -- the state-recognized benefits of marriage to same-sex people , you must grant it -- excuse me , to heterosexuals , you must grand it to people of the same sex . Now , there is a proposal in the legislature to define marriage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only now have effect if done by a constitutional amendment . Meaning first the legislature must pass it and then the people of Massachusetts must pass it in November 2004 of the next general election . That is the only way to overrule the Supreme Court decision . Otherwise , in six months , there will be some type of same-sex union that the state of Massachusetts will be compelled to recognize . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Judge Andrew Napolitano , thank you Judge . qwq @ ! NAPOLITANO : You 're welcome , John . qwq @ ! GIBSON : Coming up on THE BIG STORY , Martha Stewart 's legal dish .
