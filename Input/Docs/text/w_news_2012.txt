Many Yemenis support him too , considering him the best man to replace President Ali Abdullah Saleh and shepherd the Arab world 's poorest country out of the year-old anti-government uprising that has battered the nation and left hundreds dead . # Hadi is to be rubber-stamped as Yemen 's new leader Tuesday in a vote that can hardly be called an election . He is the only candidate , and even those who go to the polls ca n't vote against him . # Yemen has one of the world 's most active al-Qaida branches and the U.S. has remained heavily involved in the leadership transition , fearing chaos and the collapse of military cooperation in the fight against the terror network . The U.S. gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , and President Barack Obama 's top counterterrorism adviser , John Brennan , flew to Yemen over the weekend to meet with Hadi. # " I am very encouraged by his comments . He is committed as well to destroying al-Qaida and I consider him a strong partner against terrorism , " Brennan said Sunday . # One newspaper ran Hadi 's photo on its front page Monday under a headline : " The President Tomorrow . " Even Obama sent him a letter this week , voicing his support . # While highly respected by most Yemenis , few have any idea how Hadi who has not appeared in public and given only one televised speech in recent months will tackle the huge problems Yemen faces . Many just want Saleh to go . # " We want to finish with the stage we are going through now , " said driver Mohammed Abdul-Khaliq , 25 , who had pasted posters of Hadi on the doors of his taxi . " Saleh is finished . " # The two men could hardly be more different . During his 33-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploiting tribal loyalties and using the threat of Islamic militancy to win support from the West . # Hadi has remained behind the scenes , maintaining good relations with Saleh 's enemies and avoiding the corruption accusation that have mired other officials . # " He 's not very flashy , he 's not very well known , but he is considered a straight-shooter , " said Les Campbell , Middle East and North Africa director for the Washington-based National Democratic Institute , who has met with Hadi many times , most recently in December , 2011 . He said low-key approach could be a benefit after decades of Saleh 's bombast. # " Yemen had a very charismatic politician , so maybe it needs a period of time with someone who is in the background , " he said . # Hadi , now 66 , served in the military of South Yemen , then an independent nation , before defecting to the north in 1986 after a civil war . The two countries united into the modern state in 1990 , and Saleh made Hadi defense minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role appeared small , as reflected in diplomatic memos released by Wikileaks . One 2009 cable said he had " little influence with the president with regards to decision-making " and was expected to " take orders from him and implement his decisions . " # This track record gives little indication of how he will govern . # " Vice President Hadi is a blank slate precisely because President Saleh wanted it that way . His role was to stay in the shadows , " said Yemen researcher Letta Tayler of Human Rights Watch , who is in Yemen for the vote . " All of Yemen is waiting to see if he has what it takes to implement desperately needed reforms and move the country forward . " # Many worry that Saleh will remain a power broker in Yemen through relatives and allies he put in key state positions . Two of his sons run elite security forces , and his nephew heads the air force . # It remains unclear if Hadi will be able to challenge those who benefited from Saleh 's rule . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose power in the Arab Spring uprisings . To the chagrin of many protesters , he will likely remain in Yemen , where nothing bars him from political activity . # Yemenis first took to the streets to call for Saleh 's ouster in January , 2011 , inspired by the uprisings that toppled presidents in Tunisia and Egypt . # Since then , protesters have camped out in public squares and marched in huge numbers , despite crackdowns by Saleh 's security forces that have killed more than 200 protesters . Hundreds more have died in armed clashes between armed groups and security forces . # Yemen 's government has long struggled to extend its authority outside the capital , and faces a Shiite insurrection in the north and a separatist movement in the south in addition to the al-Qaida problem . # Security deteriorated during the uprising , and al-Qaida exploited the vacuum to seize territory . # In June , a bomb blast in Saleh 's palace mosque badly wounded the defiant leader , who spent nearly four months in treatment in Saudi Arabia . # After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he signed a deal brokered by Yemen 's powerful Arab Gulf neighbors in November to pass power to Hadi in exchange for immunity from prosecution . Under the deal , Tuesday 's vote is supposed to start a transitional period during which Yemen will draft a new constitution , reform its security services and elect a new parliament and president . # Saleh is now in the U.S. for further medical treatment . He is expected to return to Yemen after the vote . # Despite the lack of suspense , the vote has transformed the capital Sanaa . Once-universal pictures of Saleh have been replaced by photos of Hadi , and posters urging Yemen 's to vote wallpaper the city . # " Together , we build a new Yemen , " some say . Others show a white dove dropping a ballot into a box . # The vote has split the youth activists who led the protests . While some say it falls short of their aspirations for " the revolution , " most support Hadi if only as a means to boot Saleh. # " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution 's goals and we will support Hadi , " said protest leader and 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkul Karman. # Still , many activists have vowed to continued their sit-in to press for trials for Saleh for his alleged role in killing protesters . # Hubbard reported from Cairo. # # 
##4113751 Despite its confident saber-rattling , Israel 's concern is growing that the country is vulnerable to a devastating counterstrike if it attacks Iran 's nuclear program . # An announcement this week that a mobile rocket-defense system will soon be built just outside Tel Aviv , where Israel 's sprawling military headquarters sits smack in the middle of office towers , museums , night spots and hotels , caused some jitters . Israeli officials cite intelligence reports that Tel Aviv would be a main target of any attack . # Increasingly , the debate in Israel is turning to whether a strike can do enough damage to the Iranian program to be worth the risks . Experts believe that any attack would at best set back , but not cripple , the Iranians . # Skepticism about Israel 's ability to defend itself runs deep here . Israelis still remember Iraqi Scuds landing in the center of the country 20 years ago . In 2006 , the Lebanese Hezbollah militia seemed able to rain rockets at will during a monthlong conflict with the Jewish state . A scathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woefully unprepared . # In a questionably timed move , the Cabinet minister in charge of civil defense in recent days resigned to become the ambassador to faraway China . # Vice Prime Minister Dan Meridor , who also serves as minister of intelligence and atomic energy , indicated Saturday that Israel was facing a new type of peril . # " Whereas in the past , there was a battlefield where tanks fought tanks , planes fought planes , there was a certain push not to see the homefront affected . Now the war is mainly in the homefront , " said the normally tight-lipped Meridor. # " The whole of Israel ( is vulnerable to ) tens of thousands of missiles and rockets from neighboring countries . So of course we need to understand the change of paradigm , " he continued . " If there is a war , and I hope there is n't a war , they are not just going to hit Israeli soldiers . The main aim is at civilian populations . " # Both Israel and the West believe Iran is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat to its very existence , citing Iranian leaders calls for its destruction . # Israel has welcomed international sanctions imposed on the Islamic regime , but it has pointedly refused to rule out military action . In recent weeks , top leaders have sent signals that patience is running thin . # An Israeli military strike would very likely draw an Iranian retaliation , experts believe , which would involve either Iran firing its long-range Shahab missiles or acting via local proxies of Hezbollah in Lebanon , Hamas in Gaza or even Assad loyalists in Syria . # Experts believe the experience of the 2006 war against Hezbollah , in which the guerrillas rained 4,000 rockets onto Israel , is just a small taste of what could lie ahead . The chief of military intelligence recently said that Israel 's enemies now have some 200,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel . # But this time , Israel 's main population centers are believed to be possible targets . In the past , rockets fired from Gaza or Lebanon have been directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Haifa in the north or Beersheba in the south . # Leaders believe that Israel 's main cities would be targeted by more sophisticated , longer-range missiles . # Jerusalem is considered relatively safe because of its Islamic holy sites . But the Mediterranean coast , home to most of the country 's population , with Tel Aviv as the gleaming target at its center , seems like a very attractive target . # The business and cultural capital of the country , with a metropolitan population of over 2 million , Tel Aviv is critical to Israel 's image of itself as a modern place with a Western lifestyle . Israel happily markets the city as a high-tech , fun-loving hub . # Aside from a spate of Saddam Hussein 's rudimentary Scud missiles in 1991 , the city has never truly been tested before . Although the Scuds caused little damage memories of that war are vivid ; the strikes caused widespread panic and tens of thousands of people fled to safer areas of the country or left altogether . # A prolonged siege on the city today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn that Syria , a close Iranian ally , is believed to possess GPS-guided missiles and chemical weapons . Hezbollah has greatly improved its arsenal since the war , and militants in the Gaza Strip , to Israel 's south , are believed to be smuggling powerful warheads from Libya . # The officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing a sensitive security matter , said intelligence reports indicate that Tel Aviv military headquarters will be targeted and an alternative site for military headquarters is being prepared . # Defense Minister Ehud Barak has estimated that an Iranian attack would claim fewer than 500 Israeli casualties a statement intended to calm the nation , but which has achieved the opposite effect . # The concerns for the homefront have dovetailed with fears around the world that an attack could unhinge the global economy and spur terrorist attacks against the West . # For the past five years , Matan Vilnai a veteran Cabinet minister and one-time deputy military chief of staff has been responsible for preparing such scenarios . Vilnai recently announced he was stepping down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Sunday , he gave Cabinet a progress report on homefront preparations . His comments were not made available to the public and Vilnai did not respond to requests for an interview by The Associated Press . But Israeli media quoted the former general as being outraged at insinuations that he was " running away . " # Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged after Vilnai 's presentation that more work must be done in " an era of threats to the Israeli homefront. " # Israel 's performance in the 2006 war was widely seen as a disaster , particularly because of the military 's inability to stop the barrage of Hezbollah rockets on northern Israel . The country 's military chief and defense minister at the time were forced to resign ; a government report found " serious failings and flaws " by politicians and the military . # Five and a half years later , Israeli air defenses are vastly improved . # Its multilayered shield includes the " Iron Dome " defense system , which shoots down rockets fired from short distances , the " Magic Wand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow " missile defense system meant to protect Israel from Iran 's expanding array of missiles . # The Iron Dome has already proven effective in knocking down Palestinian rockets from the Gaza Strip.But only three Iron Dome batteries have been deployed , while expert say 14 are needed to cover the country . # The system is expected to be deployed in central Israel for the first time in the coming days . The military insists the timing is part of an annual training plan for the system , but the deployment in the nation 's heartland has added to fears that Israel was approaching a threat it has never encountered before . # The Arrow , built by state-run Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. and Chicago-based Boeing Co. for more than $1 billion , has been designed specifically to intercept Iran 's Shahab ballistic missile , which is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and whose range of 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers ) easily covers all of Israel . The Arrow has not yet been tested in combat . # There are signs that budget cuts threaten some preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government 's internal watchdog agency , found local authorities failed to properly conduct homefront emergency drills and that hundreds of thousands of Israelis did not have functioning gas masks or a designated bomb shelter . The government pledged two decades ago to distribute gas masks nationwide . # The military would not confirm a report that the country 's annual national homefront drill had been canceled due to a financial shortfall . " A variety of measures are being assessed in order to avoid harming the operational readiness of the Home Front Command , " it said in a statement . # Uzi Rubin , a former director of the Arrow project in Israel 's Defense Ministry , said the Israeli homefront is far more organized , coordinated and prepared than it was in 2006. # " Given the circumstances , we are more ready than in the past . But we still need to do so much more , " he said . # Heller can be followed at -- # # 
##4113752 Car shoppers today are less likely to end up with a lemon . # In the past five years , global competition has forced automakers to improve the quality and reliability of their vehicles everything from inexpensive mini-cars to decked-out luxury SUVs. # The newfound emphasis on quality means fewer problems for owners . It also means more options for buyers , who can buy a car from Detroit or South Korea and know it will hold up like a vehicle from Japan . # With few exceptions , cars are so close on reliability that it 's getting harder for companies to charge a premium . So automakers are trying to set themselves apart with sleek , cutting-edge exterior designs and more features such as luxurious interiors , multiple air bags , dashboard computers and touch-screen controls . # " It 's a great time to be a consumer , " says Jesse Toprak , vice president of industry trends for the TrueCar.com auto pricing website . " You ca n't really screw up too badly in terms of your vehicle choice . " # It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda and Toyota dominated in quality , especially in the key American market for small and midsize cars . Japan began building high-quality small cars and tapped into America 's growing appetite for fuel efficiency in the 1970sWith their sterling reputation , they were able to charge more than Detroit automakers and cut Detroit 's U.S. market share from 78 percent in 1980 to just under 43 percent in 2009 , according to Ward 's AutoInfoBank. # Cars from Detroit generally were n't as trouble-free in the 1980s and ' 90s . Hyundai executives concede their quality used to be poor . # However , around 2006 , as General Motors , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC were heading into financial trouble , they realized that people were shifting away from trucks and sport utility vehicles to smaller cars and car-based crossover SUVs . Gas prices were on the rise again , and the companies , which relied on bigger vehicles for their profits , had few cars to offer . # Fearing the shift , Detroit decided to go after the Japanese and shifted research dollars from trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hondas and Toyotas were quieter and more reliable , so they spent more on engineering and parts to close the gap . # Meanwhile , Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp . were busy redesigning their cars , changing to more cutting-edge looks to boost sales . Then , Toyota 's reputation was tarnished by a series of safety recalls , and Honda played conservative with new models that looked similar to the old ones . # The newfound emphasis on quality has closed the gap between best and worst in the industry . In 1998 , J.D. Power and Associates , which surveys owners about trouble with their cars after three years , found an industry average of 278 problems per 100 vehicles . By this year , the number fell to 132. # In 1998 , the most reliable car had 92 problems per 100 vehicles , while the least reliable had 517 , a gap of 425 . This year the gap closed to 284 problems . # " We do n't have total clunkers like we used to , " says Dave Sargent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automakers are improving in quality , but manufacturers that are at the bottom of the rankings are improving more quickly than those at the top , Sargent said . # Detroit 's three automakers have narrowed the quality gap considerably against brands from other countries . In 1998 , J.D. Power found 42 more problems per 100 vehicles with GM , Ford and Chrysler cars and trucks . This year the gap had narrowed to just 13 . While car prices are still rising , the narrow gap keeps Japanese automakers from charging a premium over rivals with similar models . # The competition helps consumers by giving them more choices and more car for their money . # Some examples : # Compacts : It used to be that the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic were far better than the rest , and they cost more . But the new Chevrolet Cruze and the vastly improved Hyundai Elantra and Ford Focus are giving consumers more options . The Cruze , which went on sale in 2010 , is far better than the car it replaced , the Chevrolet Cobalt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for second place and come within 9,000 of the Corolla , the small-car sales leader . # While Corollas and Civics were in short supply following Japan 's March earthquake , the Cruze offered a good alternative for people who did n't want to wait . In May , Cruze sales surged 40 percent over the Cobalt 's year-earlier sales , besting all rivals to become the top-selling U.S. compact that month . The competition has nearly erased the premium paid for Hondas and Toyotas . But that 's largely due to price increases by competitors . Since compacts have more features , people are paying more for the Focus , Elantra and Cruze. # For example , in 2007 , Toyota got an average of $15,820 for every Corolla it sold , a premium of $1,708 over what GM charged for a Chevy Cobalt . The average Cobalt sold for $14,112. # But last year the roles reversed . The premium instead went to General Motors , which got an average price of $19,858 for the Cruze , which replaced the Cobalt in 2010 . That 's $2,028 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Midsize cars : Toyota 's Camry and Honda 's Accord used to be dominant . But Ford 's Fusion , Nissan 's Altima and Hyundai 's Sonata are cutting into their sales . The Camry kept its long-held title as the nation 's top-selling car last year , but the Altima and Fusion passed the Accord , which is typically No. 2 . The price premium paid for Hondas and Toyotas has nearly vanished in midsize cars as well . Like with small cars , people are paying more because of more standard equipment and options . # " It 's very hard to find products that are n't good anymore , " says Jeremy Anwyl , CEO of the Edmunds.com automotive website . " In safety , performance and quality , the differences just do n't have material impact . " # First-year law student Randall Rosales found many good choices last year when he began looking for a small luxury SUV to replace his mother 's 2008 Infiniti sedan in Dallas . At 22 years old , he 's his family 's designated car expert . Unlike previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list has similar quality and options . # " It 's getting harder to choose because every manufacturer , at least in the luxury class , tends to have all the features we consider essential , " Rosales said . # In past searches , some automakers , including those based in the U.S. , were behind in features like Bluetooth cell phone links and touch-screen controls , Rosales said . But that has pretty much evened out , he said . # He considered the BMW X3 , Mercedes GLK350 , Lexus RX 350 and Infiniti EX35 before picking an Audi Q5 because the fuel economy of its turbocharged four-cylinder engine and its interior quality set it apart . # With quality , fuel economy and price close to equal across the U.S. market , companies also are pushing the edge on exterior design to differentiate their cars . Honda , for instance , unveiled a daring new Accord coupe in Detroit that looks like a far more expensive car , while Ford did the same with its new Fusion . # " It 's got to be beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who led work on a new Cadillac small luxury sports sedan . # Another way to stand apart is to lower a car 's base price , sacrificing profits to gain market share , at least initially . # That 's what Chrysler is hoping for with the new Dodge Dart compact , which starts around $16,000 , about $700 less than a Cruze and $500 less than the Ford Focus , the Dart 's two main competitors . # CEO Sergio Marchionne says the company wo n't make much money on a basic Dart . But the lower price will get the car on shopping lists , and Marchionne is hoping people will add features and pay more . # Chrysler in the past spent little on compact-car development and has n't offered a competitive one for years . But being late has its benefits . Chrysler learned by avoiding mistakes made by other companies , says Ralph Gilles , the company 's chief designer . # " Coming last to the party , you can bring a nice bottle of wine , " he says. # #

##4113754 A sense of order and decorum prevails at Noble Street College Prep as students move quickly through a hallway adorned with banners from dozens of colleges . Everyone wears a school polo shirt neatly tucked into khaki trousers . There 's plenty of chatter but no jostling , no cellphones and no dawdling . # The reason , administrators say , is that students have learned there is a price to pay literally for breaking even the smallest rules . # Noble Network of Charter Schools charges students at its 10 Chicago high schools $5 for detentions stemming from infractions that include chewing gum and having untied shoelaces . Last school year it collected almost $190,000 in discipline " fees " from detentions and behavior classes a policy drawing fire from some parents , advocacy groups and education experts . # Officials at the rapidly expanding network , heralded by Mayor Rahm Emanuel as a model for the city , say the fees offset the cost of running the detention program and help keep small problems from becoming big ones .

##4113756 Philosophical differences between the top two Republican presidential candidates are becoming starker as Rick Santorum drives harder on religious and social issues that Mitt Romney rarely discusses in detail . # In recent days , Santorum has questioned the usefulness of public schools , criticized prenatal testing and said President Barack Obama 's theology is not " based on the Bible . " On Monday , he likened Obama to politicians who spread fear about new oil-extraction technologies " so they can control your lives . " # The remarks contrast sharply with Romney 's even-tempered emphasis on jobs , the economy and his resume as a can-do corporate executive . # The differences give Republican voters clear choices to shape their party 's identity and image heading into the fall battle against Obama . They also will test whether social conservatives and tea partyers can outperform the GOP establishment in key states such as Michigan and Ohio . # Both men campaigned Monday in Ohio , where their audiences , styles and messages produced distinctly contrasting atmospheres. # Santorum , the former senator from Pennsylvania , appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees of the town 's Franciscan University . In his hour-long talk , Santorum never mentioned Romney or Newt Gingrich , who campaigned in Oklahoma . # He aimed squarely at Obama as he discussed abortion , marriage , the church and family . When he touched on non-social issues such as energy and the environment , he couched them in terms of epic struggles between reasonable conservatives and radical , sometimes devious Democrats . # " I refer to global warming as not climate science but political science , " Santorum said to loud applause . He said Obama has " radical environmentalist policies " that reject robust extraction of oil and gas from many U.S. areas , including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska . # In Cincinnati , on the opposite side of the state , Romney hit Santorum 's spending record as a member of Congress but stayed away from the former senator 's recent comments on social and other hot-button issues . # " One of the people I 'm running against , Sen. Santorum , goes to Washington and calls himself a budget hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no longer a budget hawk , " Romney said . " Well I am a budget hawk . " # " When Republicans go to Washington and spend like Democrats , you 're going to have a lot of spending , and that 's what we 've seen over the last several years , " Romney added . # Santorum said Obama and his allies want to frighten people about alleged dangers of petroleum-extraction techniques , including hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " which might lower energy prices . He said these officials seek to " get your dollars , turn it to politicians who can win elections so they can control your lives . " # " Understand what 's at stake , folks , " Santorum said . " It 's your economic liberty . It 's your religious liberty . It 's your freedom of speech . " He said government has accumulated power " by weakening the institutions that people rely upon in their lives . " # Santorum said those institutions include : marriage , which is hurt by the so-called " marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he said is under assault by Obama 's policies regarding contraception coverage in health care plans ; and charities , which he said would suffer if Obama succeeds in ending the tax deductibility for charitable donations . # " It 's not surprising to see the president 's assault on , first , charities , " Santorum said . # It 's not unusual for the GOP to face intra-party struggles between conservatives focused largely on social issues such as abortion and school prayer , and those focused mainly on financial matters such as spending and taxes . Sometimes the quarrels become loud and problematic , as when Pat Buchanan called for a " culture war " at the 1992 Republican national convention . President George H.W. Bush , already facing troubles , lost to Bill Clinton that fall . # Santorum , a devout Catholic , clearly welcomes the renewed emphasis on social issues generated in part by the flap over contraception policies at Catholic-affiliated institutions and the quarrel between Planned Parenthood and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer charity . # Even with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same style and message he has used for months . The former Massachusetts governor sells himself as the efficient CEO who will fix the economy . He makes little mention in his standard campaign speech of the social issues that increasingly have dominated Santorum 's events . # Romney , who is Mormon , has pushed a petition aimed at ensuring " religious liberty " and criticizing the Obama administration for requiring health plans to cover contraception , even at Catholic hospitals that oppose birth control . # He rebuked Santorum during a campaign rally in Boise , Idaho , last week but focused strictly on Santorum 's spending record in Congress . In several recent stops in Michigan , Romney did not mention Santorum. # Romney 's campaign schedule has stayed largely the same . He holds relatively few traditional campaign events in a day . Monday , for instance , Romney held one event to Santorum 's four in two states . # Romney spends significant time making phone calls and raising money , a vital task in which he outpaces his opponents . # His public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By rarely taking questions from his traveling press corps , Romney has avoided being dragged into issues such as Santorum 's claim that Obama 's theology is not Bible-based . ( Santorum later said he did not question that Obama is a Christian. ) # His target audience is the business wing of the Republican Party and most of Romney 's campaign events are held at factories or outside small businesses , giving him the opportunity to highlight his economic credentials . Romney has used the strategy since Iowa . Monday 's event was held at Meridian Bioscience , a Cincinnati-based medical device maker , where Romney addressed a handful of employees and toured the factory . # Romney advisers say they are n't changing the messaging strategy they believe has worked in other states . Holding small events allows the campaign to reach local media and show that Romney is putting in time in the state . Romney held a series of rallies in South Carolina only to lose , and switched back to holding smaller events leading up to Florida 's primary , which he won . # Hunt @ @ @ @ @ 
##4113757 Decked out in Angels gear from head to toe , Albert Pujols looked like the same slugger whose swing in St. Louis became as symbolic as the Gateway Arch . # With a halo-topped " A " logo on his cap , Pujols , his massive chest and arms filling out every corner of his red shirt , sat behind a microphone and excitedly announced the start of a new stage of his career . # " Here I am , " he said . # And here he goes . # Arriving just as the morning sun crept above the horizon , and more than a week earlier than required , Pujols reported to training camp Monday with the Los Angeles Angels , who will pay the three-time NL MVP $240 million over the next 10 years to be the face of their franchise and to hopefully bring them several World Series titles . # " I 'm just really excited to be here , it feels good to be outside , " Pujols said during a news conference held at a nearby luxury hotel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cage in St. Louis , and it feels good to be here for some spring baseball . " # Although only the Angels pitchers and catchers had to be at camp this early , Pujols wanted to be there from Day One as well . That 's how the 32-year-old has done it since breaking into the big leagues in 2001 and he was n't about to change his routine . # He also felt it was important to begin bonding with his new teammates , some of whom were caught staring at him from across the clubhouse. # Driving a black Mercedes still tagged with Missouri license plates , Pujols pulled into the players parking lot at 7:15 a.m . There were only a handful of fans waiting to catch a glimpse of the nine-time All-Star , who helped lead the Cardinals to a championship last season before leaving the only baseball home he had known . # Pujols stopped in the equipment room and shook a few hands before heading to the clubhouse , where his locker is flanked by veterans Bobby Abreu and Torii Hunter . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They well-received me as soon as I walked in there . " # Shortly after dressing , Pujols made an early request to one of the team 's media relations members . # " Let me take a peak of the ballpark , " he said before walking out a side door for his first look at Tempe Diablo Stadium , the Angels spring home , which is sure to be packed with fans throughout March . # It did n't take long for Pujols to feel like he was part of the club . # During manager Mike Scioscia 's first team meeting , Pujols cellphone rang , earning the superstar his first petty fine , which according to a team official , will require him to buy his skipper lunch . # No major league manager had a more productive offseason than Scioscia . Angels owner Arte Moreno spent $320 million in signing Pujols , left-hander C.J. Wilson ( 5 years , $77.5 million ) and reliever LaTroy Hawkins ( 1 year , $3 million ) . # Scioscia , entering his 13th season with the Angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his lineup card in the No. 3 spot and at first base . # " His whole game , not only being a presence hitting in the middle of the lineup , running the bases . He 's an offensive machine , " Scioscia said . " He 's a special player and special players are usually multidimensional , and Albert is. " # Scioscia said unless there 's a need because of injury he has no plans to use Pujols at third , where the Cardinals had him for seven games last season . # After taking some swings in an indoor cage , Pujols was driven in a golf cart to one of the back fields on the team 's minor league complex . With over 100 fans doing everything possible to get a close look from behind the right-field fence , Pujols fielded some grounders before taking his first outdoor batting-practice cuts of the spring . # With Moreno , trainers , coaches and instructors watching , Pujols ripped a few fastballs from hitting coach Mickey Hatcher for line drives and then launched a deep shot over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant palm trees and disappearing into the brush . # " It 's too early for that , " a smiling Hatcher yelled as Pujols switched spots with Kendrys Morales , who will likely bat in the cleanup spot behind him . # Jumping to a new league and facing unfamiliar pitchers might unnerve some players . Not Pujols . He intends to dig into the batter 's box the same as always , square up a fastball the way he has for years and pad statistics that are likely to grace his plaque in Cooperstown. # " The game does n't change , " he said . " When I got into the big leagues in 2001 , I did n't know anybody , so that 's how I 'm going to take it . It 's a different league , but in 2001 I did n't know any pitchers around the league . It 's going to be a little different , but when it comes to playing the game , nothing has changed except that we have a DH in the American League . " # Pujols has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he will always have fond memories of his years with the Cardinals . # " You know what , I had a great time in St. Louis , " he said . " Obviously , 11 years , you do n't just flip the page and move on . There were some great moments . I was able to accomplish two World Series and that experience is something I want to bring to this city , to Anaheim , to this ballclub and have hopefully better seasons than I had in St. Louis and hopefully more championships . " # Pujols said he 's fine physically and dismissed the idea that a wrist injury that nagged him early last season lingers. # " Just look at my numbers after the wrist injury , " he said . " It does n't bother me at all . " # And neither does his decision to leave St. Louis , right after the Cardinals won the championship . # There was a point where it looked as if Pujols might stay with the Cardinals , and be that rare player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one team . However , the second-largest contract in baseball history along with the chance to prolong his career as a DH and an additional 10-year personal services contract with the Angels was too much to resist . # It was time for him to go . # Pujols is pushing on . # " I ca n't go back and feel sorry , " he said . " It 's time to move forward . It 's like another chapter in my life and it 's time to open a new one . I do n't want to go look over my shoulder and regret the decisions I made . It was the best for me and my family " # #
