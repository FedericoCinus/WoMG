Unidentified Man 1 : Find out what they 're putting in your milk . It 's not natural . @(Footage-of-protest) @!ERIN-MORIARTY-repo : ( Voiceover ) When it 's the purity of milk in question , you 've got a bitter food fight on your hands . Unidentified Man 2 : All right ! Protesters : ( In Unison ) ... BGH has got to go ! @(Footage-of-protest) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) The battle in cities like Denver is over a genetically engineered hormone that increases a cow 's milk production . Monsanto has been selling it since early February under the trade name Posilac , but it 's also known as BGH or BST . Confusing ? That 's the least of it . Unidentified Man 3 : We do n't have any long-term studies on BGH . It 's a hormone . Think about it . @!Mr-JOE-GORE-@1Dair : This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Joe Gore never expected to find himself right in the middle of the fray . @!Mr-GORE : ( Voiceover ) We bought this place here together with Dad . He was milking 60 cows at the time . @(Footage-of-Gore-an) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) He 's a dairy farmer who 's lived his entire life in Comanche , Texas ... @!Mr-GORE : I -- I did n't have anything when we started and ... @(Footage-of-Gore-an) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) ... running the Gore Brothers ' Dairy . The family decided not to use the synthetic growth hormone and to tell their customers . @!Mr-GORE : ( Voiceover ) We do n't intend to use it . We felt like we were responsible to inform them as -- as much . @(Footage-of-boxes-o) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) So they put labels on their milk saying it was from untreated cows . @!Mr-GORE : This was the original tag that we put on our jugs . @(Footage-of-tag) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) That 's when the trouble started . And what did Monsanto do ? @!Mr-GORE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want us to tell the consumer that we are not using their product in our cows . You judge for yourself . I think it 's ridiculous . @(Footage-of-Monsant) @!Ms-LISA-WATSON-@1M : ( Voiceover ) The lawsuit was based on advertising and promotional activities that we believe misled consumers . @(Footage-of-Watson) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Lisa Watson is with Monsanto . What is wrong with the label that just tells the consumer that this milk came from untreated cows ? @!Ms-WATSON : Market research data shows very clearly that 60-plus percent of consumers who see just that statement on a label think that that milk is of a different quality , a different safety level . Those are false and misleading claims . @(Footage-of-doormat) @!MORIARTY : Monsanto thinks that by putting a label on your milk saying , ' We 're not using this growth hormone , ' I mean , are n't you , in -- in essence , saying there 's something wrong with milk produced with that ? @!Mr-GORE : All I 'm doing is answering our customers ' questions . If they have a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . @(Footage-of-milk-ca) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) And Joe Gore 's business is living up to the name on his product : Pure Milk . @!Mr-GORE : Well , we 've kind of been a forerunner in quality ever since we 've been connected with the business . @(Footage-of-cow-sta) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Unlike most dairies , the Gores control everything from the feed mill to the processing plant . They also take extra precautions along the way , including tests in their own lab to make sure that their milk is what they say it is : pure . @!Mr-KEN-HARVICK-@1D : The tighter controls you have , the better quality milk you 're going to have . @(Footage-of-Harvick) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Joe 's son-in-law Ken Harvick is manager of the dairy operation . @!Mr-HARVICK : ( Voiceover ) We feel like we take pride in making sure that we can assure the customer that there are some things they 're not going to have to worry about in our milk . @!Mr-GORE : When this BST thing come along , we looked at it , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best interest to subject our cows to it . @!Mr-HARVICK : We 've been in the dairy business long enough to know you do n't get something for nothing . @(Footage-of-dairy-p) @!Mr-HARVICK : ( Voiceover ) To ask the cow to give 10 to 15 percent more milk , which is what they say sh -- she 'll do , she ca n't do that without giving something up in return . qwq @ ( Footage-of-cows ; -d @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) What they fear the cow gives up is her health . Higher milk production may mean more stress on the cow , which could lead to more illness . In your opinion , should the synthetic growth hormone have ever been approved for use on dairy cattle ? @!Dr-RICHARD-BURROWS : No , I do n't believe it should . @(Footage-of-Burrows) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Veterinarian Dr. Richard Burrows spent 13 years at the Food and Drug Administration ; almost half that time reviewing the synthetic growth hormone . @!Dr-BURROWS : The very first data that I saw come in showed that it increased reproductive and udder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest problems that farmers confront on a daily basis . @(Footage-of-documen) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) That did n't stop the FDA from approving the drug . @!Ms-LINDA-SUYDAM-@1 : ( Voiceover ) It 's probably the most-studied animal veterinarian product that the FDA has ever approved . @(Footage-of-Suydam-) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) Linda Suydam of the FDA. @!Ms-SUYDAM : Every one of those reviews in the Science says this product is safe . @!MORIARTY : You read the label that comes with Posilac . We talk about , ' Use of Posilac may result in reduced pregnancy rates . Cows injected with Posilac are at increased risk for clinical mastitis. ' @!Dr-BURROWS : Never in my time at the Food and Drug Administration has there ever been a label with this kind of information on it . @!MORIARTY : You mean that many warnings ? @!Dr-BURROWS : That many . The companies would fight tooth and nail to keep off a simple statement like ... @!MORIARTY : ... ' Cows injected with Posilac has increased numbers of enlarged hocks and lesions . ' And -- I mean , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers to be surprised when they give their cow a drug . They want -- we want them to have all the information . @!Dr-BURROWS : I mean , it 's safe and effective or it 's not . That 's always been the standard . And ... @!MORIARTY : What happened in this case then ? @!Dr-BURROWS : In this case they just abandoned the -- you know , standard they used all those -- all those years . Obviously , it 's not safe to the animal . qwq @ ( Footage-of-cows ; -a @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) The most critical side effect of using the synthetic hormone is an increase in mastitis , an infection of the udder . The most common way to treat mastitis is with antibiotics . @!Mr-HARMAN : ( Voiceover ) If the drug 's there , it 's going to end up in the milk . @(Footage-of-Harman-) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) John Harman is with the General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress . @!Mr-HARMAN : There is widespread use -- and I think I can say this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows . And it just -- it -- it shows up in the milk . Usually that 's where drugs go : It shows up in the milk . @!Ms-SUYDAM : We are covering a major -- the major amount of drug usage in milk in our testing at this point in time . @(Footage-of-milk-ta) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) In fact , the FDA requires that every tanker of milk be tested for antibiotics when it arrives at a processing plant , but the test only detects four kinds of drugs . @!Mr-HARMAN : This is all the list of the 82 drugs that we went out and determined that were being used on dairy cows . @(Camera-pans-down-l) @!Mr-HARMAN : ( Voiceover ) Out of the 82 drugs , 30 had been approved and 52 had not been approved . @!MORIARTY : If the FDA ca n't really tell you whether the milk is free of drug residues , what does the consumer do in the meantime ? @!Mr-HARMAN : Based on what I 've seen , I would say do n't quit drinking milk . You need -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major question that kind of clouds over it -- the top of it . And you 've got an agency that 's saying , ' It 's safe , it 's safe , it 's safe . ' But they ca n't prove it . @!MORIARTY : Ultimately there 's only one person who can decide whether the milk produced with the synthetic growth hormone is safe enough to drink , and that 's the person who 's buying the milk . The question is : When you come into a supermarket , can you tell the difference between the milk that comes from treated cows and milk that does n't ? Do you read this label ? Unidentified Woman 1 : Sure do . @!MORIARTY : Does it make a difference to you ? Woman 1 : You bet . @(Footage-of-grocery) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) But most milk processors do n't label their milk . The Gore Brothers ' Dairy is one of the few that does on their product Pure Milk . @!Ms-WATSON : ( Voiceover ) There 's been a great deal of misinformation that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dairy products are the same in every way . There is no safety issue here . There is no compositional difference . @(Footage-of-calves-) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) The Gores say whether or not it 's a safety issue , it has become an issue of your right to know . And they 're willing to fight for it in court . Do you regret ever putting these labels on ? @!Mr-GORE : I regret the stuff ever come out and put us in this position . We 're just trying to make a living . And I -- you know , we 're going to stay with what we 've -- what we 've started ... @(Footage-of-Pure-Mi) @!Mr-GORE : ( Voiceover ) ... as long as we can . @(Theme-music) 
##221552 IS YOUR FOOD SAFE ? @!DAN-RATHER : Is your food safe ? Tonight : part two of our continuing investigation . In February we told you about bacteria in meat , fish and poultry . Your response was overwhelming and many of you wanted to know more . So this time we look at potential dangers that are man-made . Over the last 50 years , the use of pesticides has increased and so have cancer rates . Is there a link ? Since the 1940s more than 600 pesticides have been approved , yet for most of them the long-term health risk is , at best , unknown . And now some experts warn that risk may be greatest for those who are most vulnerable : our children . @!CHILDREN'S-MENU-PA# Unidentified Teacher : ( Voiceover ) If your name starts with the letter T ...

Pesticides are a good chunk of that . @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) The Environmental Protection Agency says about 70 of the pesticides are suspected of causing cancer . Do you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables . Unidentified Child 2 : Yeah . Unidentified Child 3 : Yeah , because it 's good and healthy . @(Footage-of-Dow-in-) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) Activists like Wiles say a young child 's diet contains a lot of these chemicals ... How about this one ? Unidentified Child 4 : My favorite . @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) ... so much so he says kids between the ages of one and five routinely exceed the EPA 's level of acceptable cancer risk . Well , here .

Probably not . Unidentified Child 5 : What about me ? @!Mr-WILES : But over the long haul , across the whole population , you 'd expect to see some effects . @!Dr-AMES : Pesticide residues in foods have never caused a case of cancer . @(Footage-of-Ames-wo) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) Dr. Bruce Ames is a nationally renowned cancer researcher . @!Dr-AMES : We have to be sure that we do n't scare people about eating fruits and vegetables with all these hypothetical , very , very minuscule risk from pesticides. @(Footage-of-a-woman) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) And he sees no special risk for children . @!Dr-AMES : ( Voiceover ) Dose is the whole thing here . The amounts given to rats are hundreds of thousands of times more than the amounts that people get into . So people are getting a few parts per billion . It 's a very tiny amount and it just is n't relevant in causing cancer . @!Mr-WILES : There 's certainly no evidence that these pesticides are safe . @(Footage-of-spray-p) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is that pesticides should be proven safe before they 're put into the food supply . @(Footage-of-a-littl) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) But how many are actually in the food supply ? 48 HOURS decided to find out . We chose four children from this preschool and tried to determine how many pesticides they 're consuming , at what levels and how that differs from their parents . @(Footage-of-inside-) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) We went grocery shopping with each of the four families . @!Mrs-CUNNINGHAM : These feel pretty nice . @(Footage-of-four-fa) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) ... the Cunninghams , the Davises ... @!Mrs-DAVIS-@1Parent : Well , I 'm trying to introduce foods that are supposed to be good for them . @!Mrs-CONLEY : It 's wet . @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) ... the Conleys. @!Mrs-CONLEY : Well , we try to eat green stuff and promote that for the kids because you 've got to teach them to eat right also . @!Mrs-CARSON-@1Paren : Here 's the pears . @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) ... and the Carsons. @!Mrs-CARSON : The red -- that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Twinkies is a lot greater than a risk from a diet of fruits and vegetables , even with these pesticides on it . We want to make that clear . Unidentified Man 1 : Now are those good bananas , Tyler ? @(Footage-of-Tyler) @!Mr-WILES : ( Voiceover ) What we 're saying is that anybody anywhere in this country ought to be able to go into a grocery store ... @!Mrs-DAVIS : There 's oranges . @(Footage-of-Davis-f) @!Mr-WILES : ( Voiceover ) ... buy lots of fruits and vegetables , take them home , feed their kids and know that their kids are protected . And currently they 're not . @!Mrs-DAVIS : ... four , five , six . @(Footage-of-the-Dav) @!DOW : ( Voiceover ) Critics like Wiles say the problem is the EPA 's pesticide limits do not even consider the differences between kids and adults . @!Ms-CAROL-BROWNER-@ : I 'm a mother . I have a six-and-a-half-year-old son . When I think about what the law does right now in protecting my son , I do n't think it 's good enough . @(Footage-of-Browner) @!DOW : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Court is adjourned . @!DOW : Less than 24 hours after a civil court ordered Lorie 's husband to stay away from her and the children , he showed up at their home . @!LORIE : He told me -- he says , ' Well , if you do n't let -- talk to those kids and ask them if I can come home and stay , ' he says , ' I will kill myself . ' And that 's when I told him , I said , ' Whatever it takes , ' and I went in and called the cops . @!DOW : The next day Lorie attends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he would take my house and those kids and I would have nothing . He would put me out in the street . I knew he was n't going to touch me , but it was the way I was feeling . After seeing him for three weeks , I was n't feeling unsafe from him , I was feeling unsafe from my own feelings . Unidentified Woman 2 : It will be OK. @!LORIE : Why do I feel sorry for him ? Woman 2 : Probably because you love him and he 's trying to make you feel sorry for him . @!DOW : You 've said you 're going to file for divorce . Will you really do it ? @!LORIE : That 's hard to say . That 's going to take some time . That 's -- that 's -- I mean , when I said it , I meant it . @!DOW : But one thing is certain . @!LORIE : What 's that ? @!DOW : You 'll have to be the one to ... @!LORIE : To make that decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're the only one that can help us. ' @!RATHER : Since that report aired , Lori has gotten a divorce and we are told she 's living a very happy life . But many battered women know that freedom often has a painful price . 
##221559 I 'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH @!ERIN-MORIARTY-repo : It 's morning at Ohio 's maximum security prison for women . Unidentified Woman 1 : 5:30 wake up . @!MORIARTY : This is the way Janet Abbott has begun every day for the past 10 years . @!Ms-JANET-ABBOTT : I 'm charged with aggravated murder . I hired someone to kill my husband . I could n't do it . I never held a gun in my life . Unidentified Man : It was at 10:00 in the evening . I was the first one on the scene . Mr. Abbott was laying in bed . I saw a hole in the back of his head with a very small amount of blood . @!Ms-ABBOTT : When I thi -- when I talk about it , think about it , yeah , it was really cold blood , and at that time it just -- to get it over with was the most important thing . Unidentified Man : This is premeditated murder . @!MORIARTY : In August , 1981 , Janet Abbott was found guilty of hiring someone to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you should have gone to prison ? @!Ms-ABBOTT : Not for life . @!MORIARTY : Why not ? You took a life . @!Ms-ABBOTT : And I saved lives , too . I saved four kids ' lives . @!RICK-ABBOTT : Mom wore dark glasses a lot . @!TIM-ABBOTT : You can tell she 's got a black eye here . @!STEVE-ABBOTT : Black eyes here . She had a bruise over there , and this is a black eye at a different -- a different time . @!MORIARTY : Janet 's four sons : Rick , Tim , Jamie and Steve . @!STEVE : My dad was a big man . He was a mean man . It was scary . @!MORIARTY : What 's the worst thing you remember ? @!TIM : The worst thing I can remember is my dad had my mother down on the floor , the back of her head -- banging her head on the floor . And I went over and -- and tried to push him off , and I was only about 12 years old at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . @!RICK : Mom got a lot of beatings for us , because he would start on us and she would stand up for us , and he would just take off on her . @!STEVE : Things like this , they did n't happen just once or twice or three times . It went on and on and on . It was -- that was our normal life . @!RICK : Dad was good . You know , he would pick anything he could grab to hit you with or throw at you . I mean , he had hammers , and screwdrivers , a blackjack that he had bought , 2-by-4s. @!JAMIE : People just do n't know . I 'm sure they never went through hell and beatings like we did . @!STEVE : That was our life . That was our life -- to live in fear . @!MORIARTY : What do you think would have happened if your mother had not had your father killed ? @!JAMIE : One of us would n't be standing here today . That 's how I feel . @!MORIARTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He -- he would have killed one of us. @!MORIARTY : The jury heard none of that because 10 years ago , when Janet was on trial , Ohio justice was blind to the battered woman . @!Mr-DAVID-GREEN-@1J : I was prevented from introducing evidence of the beatings and so forth from the four people that were very close to the case , the four kids . @!MORIARTY : The law did n't allow Janet 's attorney , David Green , to show what could lead a battered woman to kill her husband . @!Mr-GREEN : I was also prevented from introducing evidence that reflected four back operations , broken ribs , a number of other beatings that were in the form of hospital records . I could n't answer the magic question that every single jury wants to know : Why did a gentle , nice , sweet lady contract to kill her husband ? @!MORIARTY : The law has changed here in Ohio . The courts may now even consider evidence of abuse in battered women 's cases , and during our 48 hours , outgoing governor Richard Celeste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to reduce the prison sentences of some of these women or even to set them free . @!Mr-RICHARD-CELESTE : Had they been given the right to defend themselves with the facts -- brutal , shocking facts about their life experience -- they almost certainly would have not been convicted or would have been charged and convicted of much lesser crimes . @!MORIARTY : That 's what Janet Abbott claims , and so do one-quarter of all women currently serving time for violent crimes in Ohio 's prisons . @!Mr-CELESTE : There will be some women who have their sentences commuted . There will be a number of women who do not . @!STEVE : What mom did was -- it was legally wrong , but why she did it was never taken into account . The misery that we were put in , the hell that we lived was n't even considered . @!TIM : When I think of her in -- in prison , I do n't think of her as a -- as a murderer . She did n't see any other way out . She was protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battering alone an excuse for killing or a reason now from releasing Janet Abbott from prison ? @!Mr-MIKE-MOSHER : I believe that Janet Abbott was abu -- an abused , battered wife , and I believe that she was also the mother of abused children . @!MORIARTY : Mike Mosher was the prosecutor in Janet 's trial . @!Mr-MOSHER : The battered wife syndrome is n't just a battered wife . What that means is that she is suffering from some type of , like , an anxiety attack , if you will , in which all of the past aggressions well up inside of her so that at the moment that she commits the lethal act , she has had this syndrome , in a sense , take over her good judgment and reason and she pulls the trigger . @!MORIARTY : How do you know that did n't happen to Janet Abbott ? @!Mr-MOSHER : Because she did n't pull the trigger . She pulled out the pen and wrote a check . And that is much different than pulling the trigger . @!Mr-GREEN : The reason that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because of fear . It 's because of desperation . It 's because of hopelessness . It 's because they have no place else to go . I do n't think Janet Abbott should have been acquitted in this instance , but I do think that Janet Abbott should have been found guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter -- that is , killing under great emotional stress . In all probability , she would have been out in maybe three years max. @!Ms-ABBOTT : Ten years is a lot . I do n't know . I mean , you know , I took a life , and that life is never coming back , but I think I 've suffered enough for it . I missed -- I just think that he would want me out with the kids . I mean , I hope that he would . I 'm getting old . You know , that 's my worry , you know ? When I get out -- too old to enjoy life . @!JAMIE : If it comes out where they do n't let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's hard . It 's just hard . @!MORIARTY : You really want her out . @!JAMIE : Yes . More wa -- more ways than words can say . @!Ms-ABBOTT : He 's just got his hopes up so high . Now it 's getting close and it 's kind of scary . You know , what if -- what if the answer is going to be no ? And you try not to get your hopes up . Woman 1 : Downtime ladies . @!Ms-ABBOTT : Good night , Mary . You know , that 's what I pray about now . You know , God make me be strong enough to handle a no.
