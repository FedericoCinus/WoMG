That 's an extreme measure . Was that the only answer here , ban alcohol outright ? Mayor AHMAOGAK : I think that was the only answer . @!Sgt-BLETH : And , you know , it worked . After the town went dry , it was just like turning a faucet off . The acts of violence and disorder just -- just quit overnight . @(Footage-inside-pol) @!LAGATTUTA : @(Voiceover) Crime , overall , for the year dropped 70 percent . @!Sgt-BLETH : Substance-related activities , we had 211 in ' 94 , before the ban , and only 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center were practically empty ; alcohol-related visits to the emergency room , at an all-time low .

There is the heart . @!GOMEZ : Thirty minutes into the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely separated . Nothing to do . It 's completely separate hearts .

Lucy is first . @!Dr-STYLIANOS : We 've covered the heart with her own tissues . We 're going to have to break the little bit of breastbone that she has to mold it to cover the heart further . @!GOMEZ : @(Voiceover) It will be even more difficult with Millie. @!Dr-ALTMAN : This is Millie 's heart . When the babies were connected , this heart extended over to Lucy 's side .

But if we can provide a unique service that is not available any place else and which generally is life-saving , we 'll do it . @!MORIARTY : Major hospitals like this have a long tradition of giving free medical care to children for foreign countries .

There is tremendous concern that the hospitals continue to be able to provide adequate care . I 'm not even talking about the best care any more , and then when we put a lot of money into something as heroic as the separation of Siamese twins , it gives an image , even if you have those private funds , of being a poor steward of society 's limited resources . The fact that we might be technically able to do it does not give us a moral imperative to do it . @(Footage-of-Zucker-) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Tell that to Dr. Howard Zucker , who runs the unit where Millie and Lucy are fighting for their lives . @!Dr-ZUCKER : You know , a lot of times people will ask that question .

##221675 HOPING FOR A MIRACLE Announcer : From New York , here is Dan Rather . @!DAN-RATHER-host : Good evening . You 're about to witness something as rare as it is risky . Worldwide through all time , there have been only about 100 successful operations to save children who were born joined together , commonly called Siamese twins . @(Footage-of-twins-i) @!RATHER : @(Voiceover) For almost two weeks , doctors at San Diego Children 's Hospital have been weighing whether to try to add to that number , attempting to separate twin girls born joined together . And just today physicians announced their decision to operate on the girls . It is a case remarkably similar to the one you are about to see , an effort to save two small lives and write one more chapter in medical history . More than a story of science , this is a story of hope and of people whose lives are dedicated to making miracles happen . Correspondent Erin Moriarty begins our report . @!JUST-GOTTA-PRAY-# @(Footage-of-twins-M) @!Ms-DEBBIE-SCATURRO : They 're two precious little girls . Look at her smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castillo are five months old . @!Ms-SCATURRO : They 're identical twins , but I think they look -- they -- they have their own look . Millie looks like her mother and Lucy looks like her father . @(Footage-of-twins) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) By now , you know they are n't ordinary babies . @!Ms-SCATURRO : You know , they 're very -- they 're active . They want to start doing something and they ca n't . And I think a lot of it , too , may be they 're frustrated . @(Footage-of-twins) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Lucy and Millie are conjoined twins . @!Ms-SCATURRO : @(Voiceover) I think they 're just frustrated . @(Footage-of-Scaturr) @!Ms-SCATURRO : OK . All right , Sissy . OK . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Debbie Scaturro has opened up her home ... @(Footage-of-Scaturr) @!Ms-SCATURRO : What 's the matter ? @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) ... and her heart ... @!Ms-SCATURRO : A little at a time . @(Footage-of-twin-ea) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) ... to help them . @!Ms-SCATURRO : And I 've had them since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny . So they 've put on quite a bit of weight . Hi , Sis ? Hi . And Lucy , yes . Millie 's a little bit more personable . She smiles a lot more . Lucy 's much more serious . There you go . I do n't think that they realize yet that they 're -- that they 're individual people . @!MORIARTY : Where are they connected ? @!Ms-SCATURRO : The collarbone to the naval . @(Footage-of-twins-b) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Most people would call the girls Siamese twins , but not Debbie . @!Ms-SCATURRO : We do n't use -- which I think is a negative term -- you know , the Siamese -- we do n't say that . We always say the medical term : conjoined . I do n't like people to laugh or snicker or make jokes . It 's OK . It 's OK. @!Mr-STEVE-SCATURRO- : They 're not freaks . They 're still people . @(Footage-of-Steve-S) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Debbie 's husband , Steve . @!Mr-SCATURRO : You know , looking at Millie and Lucy -- they 're babies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're -- they 're just two little babies . @(Footage-of-twins-a) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) But they are a bit of a challenge . @!Ms-SCATURRO : What 's the matter ? All right , all right , all right , all right . Soaking wet . @(Footage-of-one-bab) @!Ms-SCATURRO : They poke each other and they 'll take each other 's bottles out of their mouths . It 's just like having twins , you know . They 're just connected . If there 's any advantages , at least you know where they both are . You know what I 'm saying ? All right . All right . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . @(Footage-of-Debbie-) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) When it comes to caring for kids who need help , Debbie and Steve have been here before . @!Mr-SCATURRO : We 've taken , so far , nine foster children in so far . @!Ms-SCATURRO : There you go , baby girl . @(Footage-of-Scaturr) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) They are volunteers for a charity group that helps children get medical care they ca n't get in their home country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of them . @!Mr-SCATURRO : If we did n't do this , I know nine children who would n't be in the condition they 're in right now . @(Footage-of-twins) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) In two days , Millie and Lucy are going to get a second chance at life . @!Mr-SCATURRO : My dream is just the separation , that they 're -- it 's successful and they 're healthy . That 's my only dream . @(Footage-of-hospita) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Doctors at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City are going to try to separate the girls . @(Footage-of-X-rays) @!Dr-STEVEN-STYLIANO : This is a very high-risk , extremely complex procedure . @(Footage-of-Stylian) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Dr. Steven Stylianos and Dr. Peter Altman will lead the surgical team . @!Dr-STYLIANOS : It 's this gray zone right in here that -- that holds the key to separation . That 's where the heart -- the hearts and the liver are -- are -- are lying . @!Dr-PETER-ALTMAN-@1 : Technically , there 's two livers , one in each baby , but they 're joined . @(Footage-of-X-rays) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is two hearts that may or may not be fused . @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) ... they ca n't tell if Lucy and Millie 's hearts are separate or attached , and they wo n't know until the operation is under way . @(Footage-of-X-rays) @!MORIARTY : What happens if you find that these two separate hearts , though , are joined by one wall ? @!Dr-ALTMAN : Really , the question is what happens if it 's determined that you can only come out with one heart ? And that means you can only come out with one survivor . @(Footage-of-X-rays) @!Dr-JAN-QUAGEEBOOR- : The worst-case scenario , I think , as far as I can see right now , is that you would have , like , one big hole in -- in one heart . @(Footage-of-Quageeb) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Pediatric heart surgeon Jan Quageeboor . Does that mean you lose a baby automatically , or ... @!Dr-QUAGEEBOOR : No , I do n't think so . I -- we have to make a decision at that point if that is repairable or not . @(Footage-of-twins) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) If Millie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more hurdle . @!Dr-STYLIANOS : The third major obstacle will be the -- the reconstruction of their chest wall . qwq @ ( Footage-of-X-rays ; @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Without a strong chest wall , the girls wo n't be able to breathe on their own . @!Ms-SCATURRO : What are you doing here ? Yeah . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Ms. -Sca @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) The challenge is tremendous , but the level of confidence is high . @!Dr-ALTMAN : We think and hope that we can separate the babies and have two survivors . @(Footage-of-Altman) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Why ? Believe it or not ... @!Ms-SCATURRO : This is deja vu . We 've gone through this before . @(Footage-of-Altman) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) ... they 've all done this before . @!Dr-STYLIANOS : Lucy and Millie are -- are the second set that this particular team , the entire team , has been together to do . @!Mr-SCATURRO : I 'm expecting a second miracle . @(Footage-of-twins-C) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Meet Carmen and Rosa Tavares . Two and a half years ago these twins were also conjoined. @(Photo-of-twins-bef) @!Ms-SCATURRO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five months old here . @(Footage-of-Scaturr) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Debbie and Steve took the babies into their home and Dr. Altman and Dr. Stylianos separated them . @(Footage-of-Tavares) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) That operation took a team of 52 doctors , nurses and technicians 18 hours to complete . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Carmen- Unidentified Woman 1 : Very good . @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Aside from some slight nerve damage ...

Unidentified Woman 2 : Yea . @(Footage-of-Tavares) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) ... they are now on their own two feet . Unidentified Man : ( Foreign language spoken ) Woman 2 : ( Foreign language spoken ) @(Footage-of-Tavares) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) But Carmen and Rosa had something going for them . @!Dr-ALTMAN : The good news for them was that their lives really were never at risk . They were healthy . Man : ( Foreign language spoken ) @!Dr-ALTMAN : Their anatomy was such that we could predict and know that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) There are no such guarantees this time around . @!Dr-ALTMAN : @(Voiceover) This set is different in that this is life itself . @!MORIARTY : So at this point , you really do n't know whether both babies are going to make it . @!Dr-STYLIANOS : That 's correct . @(Footage-of-crib-mo) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) But everyone agrees it 's a risk that must be taken . @(Footage-of-Castill) @!Dr-ALTMAN : @(Voiceover) These are not a pair of infants that are destined to survive and have normal lives . This is not an option for them . @!Ms-SCATURRO : @(Voiceover) If we leave them the way they are and then one dies of heart complications or something , then the other one 's going to die , and that 's so unfair .

Unidentified Boy 1 : No . Woman 1 : No colors. @!DOW : @(Voiceover) But first ... @!Ms-MICHELLE-ARCIAG : What we 're looking for is any kind of weapons , any kind of drugs and any kind of colors. @!DOW : @(Voiceover) ... a quick check to see if they 're packing more than a toothbrush . @!Ms-ARCIAGA : Do you guys want to put your stuff in the truck ? @(Footage-of-Arciaga) @!MYERS : @(Voiceover) Michelle Arciaga of the Salt Lake-area gang unit organized the event . @!Ms-ARCIAGA : We are going to do a think tank with some high-risk kids about gang violence in the community because , as adults , we always want to try and solve the problem , and we do n't ever ask the kids who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so that 's what this is about . @(Footage-of-bus-lea) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Thirty-two young people , under the watchful eye of adults , will be spending the next two days at a nearby National Guard camp ...

Unidentified Man 3 : We 're going to slide this to the other one . @(Footage-of-boys-on) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) It 's Arciaga 's job to try to steer kids like these away from gangs . @!Ms-ARCIAGA : How are you guys going to get over here with that board over here ? @!DOW : @(Voiceover) What 's your biggest problem in dealing with your job ? @!Ms-ARCIAGA : It 's probably walking the fine line between enforcement and intervention @(Footage-of-boys-on) @!Ms-ARCIAGA : @(Voiceover) Because I 'm trying to save kids . Our officers are arresting the same kids . @!DOW : @(Voiceover) One gang member walking that tightrope is 18-year-old Denny Kandt. @!KANDT : Touchdown ! @(Footage-of-Kandt) @!Ms-ARCIAGA : @(Voiceover) Denny 's one of the first gang members that I ever worked with when I took this job . I think he 's a bright kid .

Graffiti all over the place , threatening his neighbors , threatening their kids , showing guns to their kids . @!KANDT : I 'd aim at everybody . I -- I just wanted to hit them . I did n't think about what they -- how they felt , how their families would feel , how ... @!DOW : How 'd you feel ... @!KANDT : ... what would happen to me ... @!DOWN : How 'd you feel with a gun in your hand ?

I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . @(Photos-of-Kandt) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Not surprisingly , that attitude led to a 10-month prison stretch for aggravated assault . @!KANDT : There 's a lot of good things that came out of being locked up . I grew up . I had a time to think about everything . I had a lot of -- it was like a rehabilitation , man . @(Footage-of-Kandt-w) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) These days other things seem to matter to Denny ...

What is it that 's pulling you there , that 's keeping you there ? @!KANDT : Friends , excitement , the rush . It 's like a drug . It 's addicting . Everything that comes with it -- partying , just everything , the action , everything that 's around it . @(Footage-of-Dow-loo) @!DOW : Are they 9mm ? @!KANDT : I think these ones are a .380. @!DOW : @(Voiceover) That action includes four drive-by shootings at his home ... @!KANDT : There 's one right there . @!DOW : @(Voiceover) ... where he lives with his father .

Someone -- someone 's after me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , a part that comes along with it . @!Mr-DAVID-TANGERO-@ : He 's really torn between he -- he wants to grow up and he wants to move on , but yet he has this tie with the neighborhood , with the homeys. @(Footage-of-Tangero) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) David Tangero is Denny 's parole officer . @!Mr-TANGERO : The gang is his family , and it 's just like saying goodbye to your family . @!DOW : Have you been able to understand the commitment , to understand the bond that gang members make with o -- with each other ? @!Mr-TANGERO : I have n't , and -- and that 's what 's hard with law enforcement communities , people in the school and so forth , to just -- you know , they -- they lecture to kids and say ' Leave the gang . Why ca n't you just tell them you do n't want do that anymore ? ' And they ca n't . They can't. @(Footage-of-confron) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) A lesson learned at the conference , where a fight broke out between rival gang members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hatred that these kids feel for each other . @(Footage-of-Arciaga) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) But Arciaga , who has been called naive for thinking gang members can change , says it 's all part of her job . @!Ms-ARCIAGA : @(Voiceover) You have to work with gang members a very , very long time to see any change . It takes them a long time to change . You know , I think that 's our detectives ' frustration with Denny Kandt , is that they 're saying , ' Let 's just lock him up and put him away . ' And I 'm saying , ' Well , if you can catch him doing something , great . But until he goes to prison , I 'm going to keep working with him because I still think that there 's a chance that he could be saved . ' @(Footage-of-Arciaga) @!Ms-ARCIAGA : @(Voiceover) And so if that 's naive , then I 'm naive . @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Denny , you have that commitment -- that lifetime commitment to this gang , the Diamond Street gang .

##222059 RETURN TO CRACK STREET @!DAN-RATHER-host : It began as a bold experiment : to take cameras where they 'd never been before and to show you the world as never before .

##222060 DAN @!RATHER , host : Since Ericka was born , there have been great advances in treating AIDS . New drugs hold out hope that the other Erickas out there will live longer with this disease and ultimately survive it . Once that seemed unlikely .

What does that mean for her continued survival ? @!Dr-CHIN : I think what we have to do is not really focus on that aspect of it but focus on having her enjoy her life .
