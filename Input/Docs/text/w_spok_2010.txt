And Griff Jenkins is standing by in Port-au-Prince , Haiti -- Griff. @!GRIFF-JENKINS-FOX : Greta , it is a scene of devastation and despair . You 've heard that from reporters since this catastrophe hit , but once you put eyes on it in person , it is heart-wrenching . These people here in Port-au-Prince have three things on their mind . It is immediate search-and-rescue and medical attention , it is immediate food and aid , and the third thing is security . We saw no evidence of that , spending four hours driving extensively around Port-au-Prince . And here at the airport , when we landed in an aid cargo plane , we did not see any of that out there . What you 're going to see is just a sample of the tragedy that is unfolding here . We took our cameras so you could see what 's really happening here . Take a look . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) The collapsed devastated building behind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmy ( ph ) is the director here . Farah 's ( ph ) going to help us translate . Jimmy , what happened here ? Tell me about the school . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE- : I was sitting in front of the school . I was letting the student go . And when I moved , the school fell behind me . After that , there were a lot of students that died because there was not enough material ( ph ) . Because there was no material , many lives have not been saved . Until this afternoon , there were children crying for help . @!JENKINS : Did you think you might not make it out ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE- : Yes . @!JENKINS : It was very frightening , very shocking ? Are you OK ? What are your injuries now ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Yes , I 'm OK. @!JENKINS : You 're OK ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : My foot . In my right ... @!JENKINS : The right leg ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Foot . @!JENKINS : Your right foot -- yes . I looked . It 's badly damaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : No . No. @!JENKINS : No . And you need more aid here ? You need more aid ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Oui ! Of course . Of course . @!JENKINS : Do you know who to go tell that this boy is hurt ? Can you call someone to come out ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : No , I do n't think anybody know . They just hope somebody will come . @!JENKINS : Here on top of this ( INAUDIBLE ) was once a school , you can see rescue workers and Haitians trying to make a larger hole to penetrate the roof in hopes that there are any survivors . We 've seen evidence that some people certainly did not make it . It 's a very strong smell here . There 's this very sense of desperation , and obviously , the destruction you can see . From this vantage point , Greta , you can see helicopters trying to bring in aid . Beyond those helicopters is the port , where cranes were badly damaged and ships are not having success getting in there because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly over , in the hillsides , house after house , building after building , just absolutely devastated . We 're not sure what the impact of making a larger hole in the roof we 're on is going to mean for the safety of everyone here . So we wanted to give you that look , but we 're going to go ahead and pull out of this area . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) Greta , it 's not exaggerating to say it looks like a bomb went off . That young boy you saw hurt , he has a badly injured foot . My cameraman , Jeff ( ph ) , and I took that address of that neighborhood and the street of where that school is . We told every aid worker we can find here , from local Miami rescue people to the U.N . folks here , We want someone to help that boy . And as you heard from Farah , the English-speaking Haitian woman , that help is n't readily available . It seems at best disorganized , and at worst nonexistent . Now , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . And so Greta , I handed him the microphone and I said , You tell her that you 're OK . This is a young man named Curson ( ph ) . Roll the tape . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : My name is Curson Losin ( ph ) . Hello . Cami ( ph ) , Moyel ( ph ) -- this is my cousin . We 're OK . Do n't worry . So we still -- we still -- we still alive . My mom is OK . Cami -- Cami ( INAUDIBLE ) do n't , like -- do n't worry . We OK . So we still got a life . We still got a life . So thank you , FOX News TV . That 's the name . So thank you for your help . So I do n't know what 's going to -- what 's going to happen in the next week . So we 'll be OK . Do n't worry about us . So thank you for the TV. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!JENKINS : So we 're glad to get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's very real . We were driving around with two hired guards in an armed vehicle . As the sun came down , they wanted us back here at the airport . They did not want to be on that streets , and they did n't want to be in that neighborhood where we were . But they did stay at my request because I was n't going to leave without getting all the details . I can also report , Greta , that Haitians -- the folks in Port-au-Prince have something intact , it 's very important to point you , and that is their respect . They have respect for themselves . They have honor . And I have the clearest example I can offer of that -- bodies , as you 've heard , litter the streets as you drive around . I have not seen U.N . vehicles taking them out or any other aid . But I have seen everyday average Haitians carrying dead bodies out . We did not turn our cameras on them out of respect . But they are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immediate aid and they need materials to start clearing this rubble . We need to get into places where that boy was hurt and where that school was to find out if anyone 's left -- Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Griff , you get the sense -- you used the word " aid . " And let me just go to something basic like food . Is food actually coming into the airport and flowing into the community , or are there chokepoints so that food and water is not getting to people ? @!JENKINS : As best I can offer my viewpoint , I came in on an aid plane . There 's water . The plane that we were with , with Reverend Franklin Graham 's Samaritans First plane that was having trouble getting in here , had 25,000 pounds of blankets , water , water filtration systems . But as you saw when our cameras went into the community -- and we were in some of the harshest hit parts of Port-au-Prince -- nothing is getting there . The only aid workers we saw was on that rooftop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , but there 's a disconnect when it touches down here at the airport and when it reaching to folks we went out and saw today . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Griff , the problem that we -- the problem that we confronted yesterday was the fact there was congestion in the airspace , or at least on the ground , that planes were n't -- had no place to park and they could n't take off and -- and a lot of them did n't have fuel to take off . Has that problem on the ground with the airport ended , so planes can land and take off ? @!JENKINS : Well , it 's gotten better . Let me offer that . It certainly was congested . But since we 've been at the airport -- you can probably hear the planes behind me . It 's a steady flow of planes coming in . And I believe that the U.S. military has taken a stronger lead , at this point , at getting more of those planes in . The Samaritans First plane that I tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the Turks and Caicos to get on a Coast Guard to get in here -- did finally get in here late today . That 's a good sign because they were afraid they were being held out . So things have improved with that regard . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Griff , thank you . All right , now , this picture -- it says it all . You are looking at Frank Procaccini , reunited with his family shortly after midnight this morning at JFK airport after surviving the earthquake in Haiti . Frank is a member of Trinity United Methodist Church . He was in Haiti with his church when the quake struck . Frank , nice to see you . And boy , that picture -- must have been quite an experience seeing your family this morning , or at least around midnight . Was it not ? @!FRANK-PROCACCINI- : It was amazing because what we went through , I 'm so glad I 'm able to come home and see my family . It was devastating there . And we were -- God was watching out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't there , we would n't be here now . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : When did you arrive in Haiti ? @!PROCACCINI : We arrived Saturday afternoon with 30 suitcases of supplies for orphanages , hospitals , clinics and many other places that we visited . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And how long did you intend to stay when you arrived on Saturday ? @!PROCACCINI : Oh , we were supposed to stay until this Saturday coming . I guess tomorrow , we would be home at night . And we had many more places to visit , but of course , it was cut short . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : All right , where were you when the earthquake hit and what did you see ? @!PROCACCINI : We were very lucky . If you went by our itinerary , we were supposed to -- that was the only place we would have survived . Every other place , we would have been inside a building that I know 90 percent of them are collapsed now . So we were in an open field , in an orphanage . Picture it as a soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall all the way around to protect the children . And luckily , we were in that field and we were able to avoid all of the buildings that were collapsing around us by being in that open field . That was our only time that that earthquake would have not killed us. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : All right , I take it you had to leave behind all the children in the orphanage when you returned to the United States . @!PROCACCINI : Yes . They 're all fine . And yes . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Who is taking care of them ? @!PROCACCINI : Pastor Ronald LeFranc ( ph ) is the leader down there . He 's a pastor . And he takes care of the children , and he had some aides taking care of the children in the orphanage . He runs a big church in Bon Repot ( ph ) . And unfortunately , his house got damaged , so -- it 's beyond repair . He ca n't even go back and live in it . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , Frank , adults -- you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , pretty well , I mean , as well as can be expected . But you know , we 're protective of children . The children in this orphanage -- I mean , what -- how are they ? And what did you say to them ? @!PROCACCINI : Well , they 're 4 to 14 years old . They were totally in shock . But we grabbed the most of them and took them to the middle of the field . And we comforted them as best we could while the waves of the earthquake was coming upon us . It was almost like a sea of Jell-o . We were actually rolling up and down . And the school bus on the property was actually rolling . I thought it was going to tip over a couple times . But all you could say to them is , Relax , stay calm , and try give them love and do the best you can with them to try to keep them safe . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , it -- but when I think of it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dealt a really lousy hand . They 're in an orphanage , you know ? They 're not home , you know , with parents and siblings and everything . They 're in a orphanage . And now their country has been turned upside-down , devastated . And -- and that 's not the only orphanage in Haiti . @!PROCACCINI : Yes . True . It 's definitely true , but thanks to Pastor Ronald LeFranc and his congregation , they take care of those children pretty well . Unfortunately , right now , things are devastated , and it 's more like we have to build him back so he can take care of his thousand parishioners in his church . Most people now in that area are living in his church , and he 's trying to get food in for them , so -- on the other hand , too , we did not want to leave , but unfortunately , we were -- we knew we were in his way of taking care of his own ministry . He was worrying about us and also trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we knew we had to kind of get out of his way . But I would have still been there helping him to this minute . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And I suspect you 'll go back some day and help . Thank you , Frank . @!PROCACCINI : Thank you . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Next : Look at this video . It is what 's left of a hotel in Haiti . Our next guest used to live right there until the earthquake struck . She goes " On the Record , " next . Plus : A blistering attack ! White House senior adviser David Axelrod slams Karl Rove . Well , what does Karl Rove think about that ? We 're going to ask because Karl is here to go " On the Record . " We are back in two . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Well , our breaking news coverage in Haiti continues . And take a look at this video . The rubble on your screen is what remains of the Hotel Montana . Our next guest lived there -- well , at least until the earthquake struck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of external affairs at an HIV hospital and research center in Haiti . Nice to see you , Anne . @!ANNE-MACDONALD-SU : Thank you for having me , Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Anne , it 's the first time you 've seen the hotel since you left , right ? @!MACDONALD : It 's the first time I 've seen it . Unfortunately , I was -- I should have been there when it happened . I 've been there every day at the same time that the quake struck , get home from work around that time . But fortunately , a class that I take in French there was shifted this one week , out of a nine-week element , and ended up being downtown and away from the Montana at that time , so -- I had n't seen that yet , but was holding on to some hope that part of the building that I live -- I lived over the right back corner there , was still intact or -- and will still hold onto some of that hope . I 'm on the second floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who did n't make it ? @!MACDONALD : Unfortunately , yes . The wonderful woman who ran the hotel , Mrs. Cardozo ( ph ) , was unfortunately lost in the -- in the -- in the mess , as well as some wonderful colleagues . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You used to work for the Bush administration and then moved down to Haiti about a year ago ? @!MACDONALD : Yes . I went to Haiti for the first time in advance of a visit of Mrs. Bush , who was at that time highlighting the PEPFAR initiative and the incredible gains that have made in Haiti , thanks to the help of PEPFAR and the global fund and other donors . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Do you like Haiti ? Is it a nice place to live ? @!MACDONALD : Haiti is a beautiful country . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Really ? @!MACDONALD : And outside of Port-au-Prince , there are incredible opportunities for exploration , for the beaches . The mountain views are magical . And as early as , I guess , last Saturday , I was out with a group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have traveled all over the world -- absolutely marveling at the scenery that 's available in Haiti . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , many Americans , and I guess I do , too , think of , like , the incredible poverty . @!MACDONALD : Yes . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : We hear the poverty . We hear the violence . I mean , I do n't think of it ... @(CROSSTALK) @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And when you say it 's beautiful , like , it 's -- you know , that 's a surprise to me. @!MACDONALD : It 's absolutely -- those portions are absolutely there . But at the same time , there really was an emergent restaurant scene . There 's an emergent -- there 's a lot of young professionals that are moving back to Haiti . Most of my closest friends are people that had extremely successful careers in the top echelons of the world 's industries , friends who worked at the top of Wall Street , at the top of London financial sector , who were , you know , on Madison Avenue doing marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country because they saw the growth potential and saw the great gains that it was making in the last few years . And they will still work towards that end . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You want to go back ? You going to back to living , you think , when things get sorted out ? @!MACDONALD : I 'm trying to do all that I can , as much as I can , wherever I 'm supposed to be right now . I lost everything , do n't have any assets in terms of a vehicle to be able to go forward , do n't have any -- do n't have -- have no clothes to continue operating , and no water , nothing to be able to resource and provide to people there , wanted to come and try to see all that I can do to steer resources here . And hopefully , people can go to our Web site . It 's WCNChelpshaiti.org , which Cornell , our longtime partner , graciously set up very quickly , and find out ways that they can help us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that got everything going already tomorrow to serve thousands of people that are very much in need right outside our doors . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Anne , thank you very much for joining me. @!MACDONALD : Thank you for having me. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Coming up : They did it again . They must think we are all really stupid . Guess what President Obama and the Democrats just did ? Karl Rove goes " On the Record " next . Plus : Four days until the big vote , and panic is taking over ! No one knows what will happen in the Massachusetts Senate race , but we have huge new information tonight . ' 
##4072567 @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : Tonight no one knows who is going to win that Senate race in Massachusetts , and no one dares even to bet . It is so close and so important not just for Massachusetts but for you . This race could kill Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's filibuster- proof majority . And you know what that means -- it could be big trouble for health care reform . So if you think the Democrats are n't sweating this one , listen to this -- President Obama has changed his plans and is going to Massachusetts to campaign for Attorney General Martha Coakley . Karl Rove is back with us . That 's unusual -- he was n't going to campaign , now he is. @!KARL-ROVE-FOX-NEW : And if you think about it -- we have this international crisis going on in Haiti , and rather than manning his station he 's heading off to campaign for Coakley. @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : He can man Haiti from the plane . @!ROVE : But the optics of it are n't particularly good . And also , remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , last fall he went to Virginia and New Jersey not once , which is customary for a president , but he devoted three days and went five times to Virginia and New Jersey , which is really unusual -- made five stops , and lost both of those races . And the polls did n't show he had any impact at all . So the question is by going he 's going to put his imprimatur on this , and if he wins he will claim credit at the White House for turning it around . But if they lose I suspect we 'll see Coakley blamed for being a bad candidate . But you 're right , it 's a very close race , it 's going to be very interesting next Tuesday night to watch the results . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : After the trip to the Copenhagen for the Olympics I would be gun shy , but I tend to be cautious on those things . All right , you got skewered today by David Axelrod in the " Washington Post . " He even says -- he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinions but not his own facts . I urge him , " meaning you , " to take that to heart . " He says you are dead wrong . @!ROVE : I agree with hiim , facts are important . And the fact of the matter is this -- this administration last February put out a budget plan that said they wanted to double the national debt in five years and nearly triple it in 10 . During George Bush 's years in office the annual deficits ran about two percent of GDP , and that compares to 1.7 percent of GDP since World War II . This administration is planning using very optimistic projections about economic growth , they 're nonetheless projecting the deficient on their watch will run 5.1 percent of GDP . I thought this was really unusual . Let 's step back . I wrote 200 words for the " Washington Post " on the Democrats in Congress . And Mr. Axelrod while all these things are swirling around in the world proceeds to write 700 words for the " Washington Post " attacking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the deficit and spending , and which I talked about Congress , not the administration . So I 'm going to be responding to Mr. Axelrod and setting the record straight by relying on the facts about what this administration has been doing on spending , deficit , the TARP , and other issues that he raises in the speech . Watch for it in the pages of the " Wall Street Journal " next week . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : So what do you think it was . If you said that your writing was about Congress and the White House via David Axelrod responds , he does 700 words to your 200 words , you got under his skin . @!ROVE : I got under his skin . And look , any day that the Obama White House is sending forward one of its most senior people to respond to me is a day that the White House has wasted in its messaging . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : What he says is that President Bush 43 got $236 billion dollar surplus . He then says when President Obama got into office he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : There 's an interesting thing . Go back and take a look where was the deficit January 20th , 2009 ? Like $400 and some odd billion . The rest of the money , that other $900 trillion -- $900 billion came from pending that happened on the Obama watch . He 's blaming President Bush for a $787 billion dollar stimulus bill , a $30 billion expansion of the S-Chip , a $410 billion omnibus spending bill . So I thought that was really artful . We are going to blame on Bush spending that took place on our watch is what President Obama 's chief adviser is saying . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : What he 's saying is that they had to do that -- if I can be so -- try to interpret what he said and repeat what he said of it . He said the reason why they had to do was because of the laissez-faire and fiscal irresponsibility attitude excesses of the financial industry , and he says that helped create the worst economic situation . @!ROVE : Is n't that interesting , because he talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that took a downturn in the business cycle and turned it into a worldwide calamity ? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . And who in 2005 when he came to the United States Senate eagerly and early joined a filibuster on the reforms that the Bush administration had been pressing for Congress to pass since February 2001 ? The newly elected senator from the state of Illinois , Barack Obama , who finally in September of 2008 voted to for the reforms that Bush had been pressing for to subject Fannie and Freddie to the same degree of regulation that bank , savings and loans , and credit unions . The guy who had the laissez-faire attitude toward regulation was Barack Obama , Mr. Axelrod 's boss . Stay tuned . I 've got a fact-based , numbers-based , logic-based response to Mr. Axelrod . But I thought it was interesting they read my 200 words and get a little exercised in the West Wing . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : So I guess it 's fair to take away from this that you do n't agree with Mr. Axelrod ? @!ROVE : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece that he specifically dealt with . What he simply said is , we 're not responsible for the spending on our watch , and Bush did a bad job with deficits and the debt , when these people are planning to double the size of the national debt in their first five years . That 's their plan . I loved it . He says Bush did n't pay for the Medicare prescription drug benefit . Well , neither are they . He said Bush did n't pay for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq by raising taxes . Well , neither are they . I 'm getting ahead of myself . I 'm going to have it all laid out in a very logical and fact-based way , next week . Stay tuned . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : I e-mailed the White House and asked if they wanted to send someone over to present me with some information , some research so that I can do this . I 've heard nothing back from them . So I guess we 'll have to wait and see . @!ROVE : Hyperventilation instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your op-ed and see if there 's an op- ed in response back . Before I go , who is going to win Tuesday ? @!ROVE : You know , it 's Massachusetts , so your head says the Democrat , but my heart says Brown has run a superb campaign , she has run a lousy campaign . I think people in Massachusetts are fired up to have an independent voice , a conservative with principles and values . And she has been a dreadful candidate who said I will get along and go along with Washington . And this week we saw it . Coming here to Washington to have a fundraiser among lobbyists representing pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies ... @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : Bad timing . @!ROVE : It 's not just bad timing , it 's a bad thing to be doing in the final weeks of a campaign . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : Karl , thank you , and I look forward to your response in the " Wall Street Journal " . @!ROVE : Thanks . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Here 's a look at what 's coming up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hey , Greta , actor Danny Glover says the USA is harming Haiti . And Glenn beck on what he learned this week from Sarah Palin , coming up on " The Factor . " @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : That 's O'Reilly at 11:00 p.m. , but we still have 20 more minutes live . Next , we gave Steve Moore a homework assignment last night . Did he do it ? He 's back tonight to go " On the Record . " We 'll see how he does , next . And we are beginning to feel sorry for NBC . Conan O'Brien strikes again , and NBC executives most be furious . Did you hear what Conan did ? We are actually going to show you . @(NEWS-BREAK) @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : No one would have imagined this -- that red hot Senate race in Massachusetts is too close to call . According to a new Suffolk University poll Republican State Senator Scott Brown is now ahead of Democratic Attorney General Martha Coakley by four points . But can we really trust the polls ? And what is happening on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state house reporter for " The Boston Globe . " Matt , how much faith do we put in these polls , or is anyone putting faith in them ? @!MATT-VISER- " BOSTO : Polls are all over the map . All polls , though , indicate that it is a very close race , including the internal polls from the campaigns and from the Democrats . It does look like it 's a close race , at least a tossup . It 's hard to tell with the sample size , it 's hard to tell who is going to come out this election comes one day after the -- after a holiday . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : Massachusetts , you got a large democratic legislation and considerably smaller Republican , but you have a pretty hefty size of independents . Do you have any clue of polling data any information of where these independents fall ? @!VISER : All polling seems to indicate that Scott Brown is ahead among the independents . And independents makes up about 50 percent of the voter registration . Democrats , there are about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really energize the Democrats she may do better , but it 's hard to tell at this point . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : How ugly or nasty is this race , or is this a polite race ? @!VISER : It is definitely not a polite race . They are really hitting each other right now , going back and forth . There 's a lot of third-party ads out there also . Just about every other ad , or sometimes three consecutive ads are from each of the campaigns . So there are a lot of ads out there , it 's nasty , negative , and pretty hard-hitting , and will only get more so probably over the next couple of days . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : We know the big name coming for Attorney General Martha Coakley . She 's got President Clinton and President Obama is now coming . Who does the Republican candidate , State Senator Brown , who does he have coming to campaign for him from outside of state ? Today he had Rudy Giuliani , who campaigned with him in the north in Boston 's Italian section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in and campaign with him . Tomorrow he 's with former governor Bill Wells from Massachusetts . But other than that there 's not a whole lot of big name Republicans . He 's trying to sort of court the independents in Massachusetts , so he 's walking a fine line between appealing to them and how much national support to bring in . He 's taking national money , but he 's not bringing in as many national Republican names to Massachusetts as of yet . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : What 's the biggest difference -- is there one particular issue that truly divides these two ? @!VISER : I think you would have to say health care is the biggest at least the way it is being seen as an international prism . Scott Brown definitely opposes it , Martha Coakley definitely supports it . Scott Brown 's focused on terrorism also , where they are sharply divided , or he 's trying to make them divided . Tax policy is another issue that Brown has really hammered away at with Martha Coakley . So those are the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that most clearly divides them and is most clearly on the minds of people right now . @!GRETA-VAN-SUSTEREN : It is a very exciting race because there 's a lot hanging on it , especially that 60 Democrat in the U.S. Senate , that filibuster-proof Senate . So we 'll be watching . Thank you , Matt. @!VISER : Thanks Greta. ' 
##4072568 SEAN @!HANNITY , HOST : And this is a FOX News alert . Three days after an earthquake ravaged the nation of Haiti the death toll is believed to be at 100,000 . Now meanwhile tensions in the Haitian capital are rising as rescuers race against time to find those still alive beneath the rubble . Now the Haitian government says that as many as 40,000 may still be buried . Now a 60-year-old American man was pulled alive from beneath the remains of a hotel early this morning . Those on the ground are increasingly desperate for food and water , and relief efforts are focused on getting those basic goods to the victims . Now the American relief effort is well underway with the first wave of troops arriving last night and additional soldiers and marines joining them earlier today . Now according to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Michael Mullen , between 9,000 and 10,000 American troops are expected to reach Haiti by Monday . And the Pentagon says that is ready to send more . Now Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development . Now they will be joined by the U.N . Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon . And the Haitian national police have virtually disappeared in the wake of this tragedy . And a 3,000-member U.N . peacekeeping force is now trying to maintain law and order . And now meanwhile , the Massachusetts Senate race is getting more exciting by the day . Tonight the news out of the bay state is good news for Republicans . Now the latest poll has Republican Scott Brown ahead of Democrat Martha Coakley by four points . And Coakley is n't doing anything to help her chances . Now in a radio interview yesterday she took a swipe at pro-lifers and Catholics alike . Here 's what she told radio host Ken Pitman about those who would hesitate to prescribe the morning-after pill based on their deeply held religious beliefs . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MARTHA-COAKLEY-@1D : The law says that people are allowed to have that , and so then if you -- you can have religious freedom , you probably should n't work in an emergency room . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coakley thinks that Catholics should be denied jobs in those emergency rooms on the basis of their religion or if they should just voluntarily quit ? Pretty unbelievable . As if Coakley is n't doing enough damage on her own the Democratic Party is pitching in to destroy her chance for victory . The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released this ad , including -- and intended , by the way , to suggest that Scott Brown is cozy with Wall Street bigwigs , now it used these images of the World Trade Center in the background as well as destroyed Marriott Hotel on the Trade Center 's western side . Now in a testament to just how desperate the Democrats have become well , the president , he 's headed to Massachusetts , Sunday , to campaign for Coakley . And joining me now to discuss the state of the race in the great state of Massachusetts , the People 's Republic , are former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and nationally syndicated radio talk show host , also " Boston Herald " columnist , Howie Carr . Guys , good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great to be with you , Sean . Thank you . @!HOWIE-CARR-RADIO- : Thank you , Sean . @!HANNITY : Howie , this would be , I guess , the equivalent of the Red Sox winning the World Series again ? @!CARR : Yes , this is a great opportunity for Scott Brown . He 's a very good campaign , obviously . And she 's run a terrible campaign , Martha Coakley . I guess you 're going to talk about her record a little bit later on . And it 's finally catching up with her . And I think the big problem , though , here for her is health care . You know I think this is a referendum on health care . And the people in Massachusetts do n't like it much more than anybody else does . @!HANNITY : Which is pretty amazing , Democrats outnumbering Republicans , 3-1 . Mike , let me turn to you . @!HUCKABEE : Sure . @!HANNITY : Let 's look at the big picture here . What does it mean when a state 3-1 , Democrats , Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the fight of their life , and now seemingly behind ? @!HUCKABEE : This could be the beginning of a political tsunami . Just today Arkansas had another Democrat who said he 's not running . Dick Snyder has been there a long time . No one has ever touched him . @!HANNITY : Right . @!HUCKABEE : This race is one -- no Republican has been in the Senate seat in Massachusetts since 1972 . By the way , let me complimented Howie Carr . I think his writings on this have been brilliant . But the big picture is , that the momentum is against the health care proposal , against Obama , against Pelosi and against Coakley . No doubt about it . @!HANNITY : Yes , but , Howie , here look , you 're on the ground there . There 's been a series of screw-ups , some mistakes by Coakley . Campaign manager knocking down a reporter , which happened this week . And of course she did n't see anything even though she was right over the whole thing . This comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could you not want to shake the hands of Boston bruin fans when they are flying the flyers at Fenway Park ? @!CARR : Yes , she -- I think , you know , Sean , I think that the Democrats of Massachusetts have long assumed that once they won the primary they 've got it made . I mean this is -- she made the same mistake Mike Dukakis did in 1978 . He did n't think George Bush was going to be a problem for him because he was the Democratic nominee . She thought she had it won . That 's why she was down in D.C. the other night . You know ? She -- she thought the race was over and she could just pick up some contributions from some lobbyists. @!HANNITY : Yes . @!CARR : And , you know , Scott Brown just came out of nowhere and he 's a street fighter and he 's really taking it to her . @!HANNITY : Yes , and by the way there are no terrorists , Governor , in Afghanistan according to Martha Coakley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell the name of her own state . @!HUCKABEE : Those kind of gaffs are the things that -- are the marks of the amateurs in the early stages of the campaign . When they happen late in the campaign , it really is a sign that the candidate is in trouble . Scott Brown had probably the line of the decade when David Gergen asked about Ted Kennedy 's seat . And he very just brilliantly came back and said that 's not Ted Kennedy 's seat , that 's the people 's seat . @!HANNITY : Great line . @!HUCKABEE : That was a knock out blow . That 's a knock out blow . @!HANNITY : That was a Mike Huckabee line in one of the debates . @!HUCKABEE : I wish I could be that smart . @!HANNITY : Howie , does Obama showing up Sunday help him or hurt her ? @!CARR : Well , you know , I think the Democrats thought well , we do n't want to energize the Republicans any more . But their -- you know , the absentee ballots have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks . So they figured , they ca n't energize the Republicans and the independents any more . They have to get out the urban vote , the minorities vote , and she ca n't do it . I mean she 's hopeless . And so they 're going to take a chance . And if she loses on Wednesday , I mean , I 'm sure you 're going to have a lot of fun showing a picture of Obama with Corzine and then you 're going to show a picture of Obama with Martha Coakley. @!HANNITY : Let me tell you . @!CARR : It 's risky . @!HANNITY : Now we 're going to get into a serious issue in the next segment . And I want to get your thoughts on the ground and then we 'll get Governor Huckabee 's thoughts . There 's a case about a police officer back in 2005 that was accused of raping , with a curling iron , his 23-month-old niece . And Coakley 's handling of this case , literally letting this guy out on bail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her handling of this case -- how big of an impact is that having on race on the ground ? @!CARR : It 's having somewhat of an impact . I mean , you know , she 's from the -- she comes out of Middle Sex County District Attorney 's Office , and they 've had a history of politicizing cases . I had a guy with me today , Tookie Emerald ( ph ) . I mean he and his mother and his sister , they did eight years and he did 17 years for a so-called child abuse they did n't do . I mean they were framed . It was like a modern equivalent of a Salem witch trial . And they are convicted and yet this politically connected pop which you 're going to hear about is -- you know , basically gets a walk and they let him out on personal recognizance . And she never even got a conviction . There 's a state senator that was caught stuffing cash into her bra on an FBI video tape . She -- Martha as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some restitution on campaign funds . She did n't do it . And Martha has never taken any action against her . She is not a Joe Friday , let 's put it that way . @!HANNITY : All right , Governor , first of all that case about the rapist is almost , you know , unimaginable to me . The guy ended up getting two life sentences . Your thoughts on that and do you think Obama helps or hurts her Sunday ? @!HUCKABEE : I think Obama ultimately hurts because it shows that he 's having to go and try to save her , and if he ca n't , like the Corzine race , like the race with Bob McDonnell winning the governor 's race . But the problem that she 's got , a lot of these things coming out of these prosecution cases are coming out too late for her to recover . This is the kind of thing , if you 're going to have it happen and you will , let it happen six months , a year before the race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have time to recover . I think it kills her . @!HANNITY : It almost seems like one of the worst last weeks I think I can ever think of following campaigns in my life . @!HUCKABEE : This is going to be written in the political textbooks as how not to win a Senate race in a state where you ca n't lose one . But yes , you can , and she 's going to prove it . @!HANNITY : And if the Republicans win this political earthquake 9.9. @!HUCKABEE : This is huge . @!CARR : What happens to Blanche Lincoln , Governor Huckabee ? What happens to Blanche Lincoln if Scott Brown even comes close ? @(CROSSTALK) @!HUCKABEE : Howie , even if Scott does n't come close , Blanche needs to get some boxes and start packing . @!HANNITY : All right , guys , good to see you . Howie , we 're counting on you to pull out the state . We 're counting on you to pull out Arkansas . Still -- and thank you both for being with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here is a sneak peek. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!HANNITY-@1voice-ov : It is the case of Martha Coakley wants Massachusetts voters to forget . A police officer accused of sexually assaulting a baby walked free without bail . Did Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley give this predator preferential treatment because of his political connections ? And you have heard of the cornhusker kickback and the Louisiana purchase . But tonight Democrats have found a new way to buy health care and sell-out American democracy . It is called the union exemption and the details will leave you speechless . All of that plus Kirsten Powers , Kimberly Guilfoyle and Nina Easton . Much more @!HANNITY straight ahead . @!HANNITY : So with the race in Massachusetts just days away Republican Scott Brown now leading Democrat Martha Coakley in the polls . The Coakley campaign is scrambling to regain its footing . But with details of Coakley 's controversial record as D.A . coming to light , well , that could prove a difficult task . Now one case in particular is now getting national attention and is raising serious questions about Coakley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officer named Keith Winfield , who in 2005 was accused of a horrific crime a small child . Now believe me , details of this case are even difficult to talk about . Now prosecutors alleged that while babysitting his 23-month-old niece , that Winfield sexually assaulted her with a hot object , likely a curling iron . Now the child suffered massive injuries and was hospitalized for a month . But following this unthinkable crime against a defenseless child the " Boston Globe " reports that a grand jury overseen by D.A . Coakley declined to charge Winfield . Now the outrageous handling of the case by Coakley 's grand jury prompted the child 's mother to file criminal complaints against Winfield . Then and only then was Coakley able to secure grand jury indictments to charge him with assault and battery . But Coakley 's questionable judgment did n't end there . It turns out that in the end her office recommended that Winfield actually be released without posting bail . Now in response to this outrageous miscarriage of justice the girl 's family hired an attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's rapist behind bars . Now Frisoli also had his own theory on why Coakley declined to pursue the original investigation . He alleged that it had to do with Winfield 's political connections namely his father 's work as a powerful union rep who may have had ties to Coakley 's political campaign . Now Frisoli was so outraged by Coakley 's behavior he ran against her in 2006 for attorney general . He lost that race and sadly passed away in 2008 . And in 2007 justice was served , Coakley 's successor won a conviction against Winfield that put him behind bars for two life sentences . And joining me with more on this unbelievable story is Larry 's brother , Frank Frisoli . Frank , thanks for being with us . And I 'm sorry about the passing of your brother . @!FRANK-FRISOLI-BRO : Thank you . @!HANNITY : All right . Why do n't you -- I want people to understand , because your brother actually was motivated to run because of this case . Now can you explain a little bit more detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!FRISOLI : Sure . When the event occurred in -- I think it was October 13th , 2005 , shortly thereafter the family -- we had known the family for years . The family contacted by office and my brother agreed to represent the mother . And within probably a month of the initial assault , within a few days , I think the Department of Social Services report came out October 17th , like four days after the event had occurred . And it recommended criminal prosecution . I know my brother Larry was involved at that point . And he put together a package that he presented to Coakley 's office . And they had that package in mid November of 2005 . Within approximately a month of the event . He got frustrated by the response of Coakley 's office in failing to do anything . And on January 12th , 2006 , he sent a letter to Coakley 's office and said , you 're not prosecuting him , you 're not doing anything . We 're going to start the process . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the mother to the local district court and file an application for complaint . And that was met with an immediate response from Coakley 's office of , do n't do that , you 're interfering with our process , we 're going to convene a grand jury and we expect him to be indicted . @!HANNITY : Yes , but . @!FRISOLI : So my brother immediately . @!HANNITY : Yes , go ahead , sir . @!FRISOLI : So my brother immediately responded by advising them . You know , he was a former district attorney down in Norfolk County . That 's how his career started . He immediately advised them he would n't interfere in the process and would wait . And as the process dragged on in April , he then decided he 'd run against her because it appeared she was doing nothing . A grand jury was ultimately convened in May and I know that my brother had had regular communications with the office . The family was frustrated nothing had been done about this horrific event . In May , a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time is that when that grand jury was convened evidence was presented and Coakley 's office instructed the grand jury that they did n't want an indictment returned . They wanted to go get additional information and they then dismissed the grand jury . @!HANNITY : And . @!FRISOLI : That is n't what was told to us . What was told to my office , by Coakley 's office , was that the grand jury failed to indict . And my brother then engaged in a number of discussions about the information presented to the grand jury of critical importance , it seemed to us , was in the medical records , the medical professionals , nurses and doctors made repeated notes as to the child 's reaction when she was being examined . She was blaming the uncle for doing this . She kept saying uncle hurt me . You know , no uncle . That sort of thing . And what my brother heard out of Coakley 's office is , these are statements of a 2-year-old child , they are unreliable , we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But . @!FRISOLI : My brother as a former district attorney thought that was outrageous . @!HANNITY : Well , it 's outrageous because the girl was in the hospital for a month . So this guy Winfield throughout this entire period of time , while they 're waiting , a child rapist , who in the end ended up getting two life sentences , this guy is out and about and then Coakley decides that at one point she was even with the evidence in play going to let this guy out without any bail . When did that happen ? @!FRISOLI : Well , that happened when he was subsequently indicted . But let me just back up one half step . What happened after the May grand jury is that my brother then brought the mother in the local district court and filed the application he had said he was going to file some six months before . And in the course of that process , he presented the same package to the clerk and asked for probable cause hearing and was instructed , why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that belongs . And his response was she does n't want to do anything . He was made to wait about an hour while the court 's on the phone and they said we 'll give you a day . The normal process is when you file an application for criminal complaint , you get a date in 5 to 7 days . His date was a month later . The day before -- the hearing date was August 1 , the day before that the district attorney advised that the grand jury had been convened , they expected an indictment to issue and on that basis the application for criminal complaint was withdrawn . The grand jury did indict . So it 's been opposition from the onset . That this indictment was n't going to happen , but for my brother forcing the issue . @!HANNITY : Wow . @!FRISOLI : If he had n't filed the criminal complaint they 'd still be looking at this . @!HANNITY : Frank . @!FRISOLI : What I found outrageous is that Miss Coakley defended this by saying first they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had to get additional information for the second grand jury . Well , the additional information was purportedly just this guy 's telephone records . @!HANNITY : Frank . @!FRISOLI : . and employment history and things that were available before and I do n't see as especially critical to indicting him . @!HANNITY : All right . Frank , it 's an unbelievable story and horrible judgment . I 'm sorry about your brother . Thank you for sharing this on the eve of a very important election , we appreciate it . @!FRISOLI : You 're welcome . @!HANNITY : And coming up , even Nebraskans are upset with Ben Nelson over the cornhusker kickback . We 'll tell you what happened to him at a pizzeria in Omaha . Plus Harold Ford , Jr . is trying his best to become a New Yorker . But he bombed at a recent interview when asked if he supports the New York Giants or the New York Jets ? You wo n't believe his answer . Hillary-esque . Straight ahead . @!HANNITY : And tonight in " Hannity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Ben Nelson cast the decisive vote in favor of a government health care takeover after , of course , securing a bundle of money for his home state . Now it appears that that did not win him any friends in conservative Nebraska . Politico.com reports that last night he and his wife were booed out of an Omaha pizzeria by angry customers who apparently yelled things like , " Get him out of here ! " Well , there may be no consequences in D.C. , but it 's good to see that the good folks in the Midwest know how to hold their representatives accountable . And Harold Ford , Jr . is trying his best these days to fit in as a New Yorker . Now that he 's considering running against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand . But when he was asked which NFL team he supports , the New York Jets or the New York Giants , well , he proved just how out of touch he really is . Now according to Ford , he likes the Giants more because when he 's in town he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regency . You know that luxury hotel on luxurious Park Avenue . Now keep in mind this is the same guy who when asked if he 'd ever been to Staten Island said , quote , " I landed there in a helicopter so I can say yes . " Not exactly a man of the people are you , Harold ? Now you may remember former U.N . weapons inspector Scott Ritter , you know , the outspoken critic of President Bush in the Iraq war ? Well , he 's back in the news . And I do n't think he 's going to be happy about it . Ritter was arrested in an online sex sting for engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior on a webcam to a Pennsylvania police officer . Now the police officer was posing as a 15-year-old girl . Now Ritter was released on $25,000 bail . I 'm not sure how smart that was . He may be a repeat offender in 2001 , he faced similar charges but said that the police were targeting him because of his courageous criticism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt for the most wanted terrorist , Osama bin Laden , that continues and to bolster efforts around the world to find him , the U.S. State Department has released brand-new age progression photos of bin Laden . Now take a look , the images have been digitally altered to show what he may look like today . Now bin laden who is now 52-years-old is believed to be hiding along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan . And by the way , a $25 million bounty remains hanging over his head . I hope someone collects it . And that is the news tonight from " Hannity 's America . " And coming up , the president is doing his best to pass health care so he 's made a shady deal with union leaders to get them onboard . Of course he 's using your money and of course he 's doing it behind closed doors . We 'll tell you the details . You will be outraged . That is next . ' 
##4072569 @!HANNITY : And tonight on our great , " Great American Panel , " he is a Democratic pollster , author of the best-selling book " The Political Fix . " Doug Schoen is here . She is the Washington editor for Fortune magazine and columnist for TIME magazine . FOX News contributor Nina Easton is here . And he 's a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board and the writer of the Best of the Web column on OpinionJournal.com . It 's a really short column . James Taranto is with us . That 's one of the longer columns that -- that is being written . So you do a lot of hard work . And I read it , and I love it . Guys , thanks for being with us . All right . Before I show this -- this latest debacle by Coakley in Massachusetts , general thoughts . Doug , you 're the -- you 're the Democrat . Democrats struggling to save Massachusetts ? @!DOUG-SCHOEN-AUTHO : Sean , everything is moving against Coakley . That 's not ideology ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brown . The key are the independents . They 're breaking two or three to one for Brown . They 're about 40 to 50 percent of the registrants in Massachusetts . The energy and enthusiasm is with the opponents of Obama. @!HANNITY : Why ? Why do you think this is ? @!SCHOEN : Because health care is unpopular . The Obama agenda is unpopular . The tea party movement is energized . All the enthusiasm that in 2008 that was with the Democrats is now with the Republicans . @!HANNITY : Nina ? @!NINA-EASTON-FOX-N : I would agree with everything that Doug says , and the intensity is clearly on Brown 's side , on the Republican side . The other thing that people do n't focus on this dirty little secret of liberal Massachusetts , is that they do n't elect women . They have one woman in their congressional delegation . @!HANNITY : She was an attorney general . @!EASTON : Yes , that 's fine , but they do n't elect women . They now have one woman -- and when I say do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have one in their congressional delegation now . Before her they had n't had a woman in the congressional delegation for 25 years , and they had n't had a Democratic woman for 35 years . @!HANNITY : James , even Barney Frank -- I never thought I 'd quote Barney Frank , ladies and gentlemen . But Barney Frank , he even says health care is dead if Brown wins . @!JAMES-TARANTO-OPI : Yes , although I noticed that Congressman Chris Van Holland of Maryland , the Democrat , said today that they can get this through the Senate via reconciliation , which only requires 51 votes . I love the fact that a House member is issuing this threat , a man who 's in absolutely no position to do anything whatever to carry it out . @!HANNITY : Yes . @!EASTON : Just one other thing on Massachusetts . If Brown wins , the big question is the secretary of state in Massachusetts going to delay instituting his seat there long enough for the Democrats to get that ... @!HANNITY : That would be -- let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!EASTON : He 's talking about it . He 's talking about delaying for 20 years . @!HANNITY : Firestorm . It will be viewed -- if they do that , it will be -- look , at that point I think the Republicans can win 60 seats in the House . @!TARANTO : If they 're electing a Republican to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts , a state that once elected Michael Dukakis and John Kerry as a ticket ... @!HANNITY : Yes . @!TARANTO : ... is that 's not enough to send a message to Washington , there is no getting through to these people . @!HANNITY : Even though Obama 's going in on this Sunday , there 's still an effort to try and distance themselves from Coakley while she 's run a bad campaign , which by the way , is true . She said there were no terrorists in Afghanistan , No. 1 . She has one of her campaign people throw over -- knock over a reporter the other day . She goes to D.C. She 's begging for money . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , 1.3 million on the Web at the same time . One of the latest debacles -- I 'll show you this tape here -- is Coakley and her comments about Catholics , which it 's the second largest Catholic population in the country . Roll this tape . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!KEN-PITTMAN-RADIO : If you 're a Catholic and you believe what the pope teaches , you know , that any form of birth control is a sin , you do n't want to do that -- that ... @!MARTHA-COAKLEY-@1D : No , but we have a separation of church and state here , Ken , let 's be clear . @!PITTMAN : In the emergency room you still have your religious freedom . @!COAKLEY : The law says that people are allowed to have that . So then if you -- you can have religious freedom . You probably should n't work in the emergency room . @!PITTMAN : Wow . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : Wow is right . @!SCHOEN : This is gaffe after gaffe , Sean . But fundamentally , this is a national election . And as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massachusetts party advantage out of play . It 's an election fought on issues related to what 's going on in Washington . And with the president going in Sunday , my sense it will harm the Democrats more than helps . @!HANNITY : Does Obama harm or help ? @!EASTON : He went into New Jersey , and he went into Virginia , so he 's in danger of looking ... @!HANNITY : And he went to Copenhagen . @!EASTON : And he went to Copenhagen . @!HANNITY : Do you agree with Doug . Does he hurt Coakley ? @!EASTON : I do n't think he hurts Coakley , but I think he could hurt himself . @!HANNITY : Good point . @!TARANTO : I think he hurts her a bit , because , you know , Obama is still reasonably popular personally in Massachusetts . But Obama care is not . According to the Suffolk University poll , 51 percent of people in Massachusetts are against it . Only 36 percent are in favor . People are upset about Obama , not personally , but about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , it reminds people that they -- this is an opportunity to send a message to Washington . @!HANNITY : There was a National Journal poll . Only 39 percent of Americans . Here we are one year into the Obama presidency , and only 39 percent of the American people would vote to reelect him . Fifty percent would vote against him . Now here 's my question , and it 's a bigger-picture one . You 're a Democrat , Doug . More moderate , more mainstream . Where is that one Democrat that says , " I 'm tired of the bribes . I do n't want to bribe Mary Landrieu . I do n't want to bribe Ben Nelson . I do n't want to bribe the unions " ? Where is that one Democrat that says , " This stinks to high heaven , and it 's destroying our party " ? Where is he ? @!SCHOEN : The Democrat has n't shown up yet . @!HANNITY : Where 's Evan Bayh ? Where 's Ben Nelson ? Where 's -- where 's Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made these special deals . This is more like a parliamentary system , Sean , than an individual , democratically ... @!HANNITY : They 're destroying your party . @!SCHOEN : Moderation as I know it in the Democratic Party is an endangered species . @!HANNITY : Nina , do you agree with that ? @!EASTON : I think what 's happening , too , is that the Democrats , they fear -- they fear the health-care plan passing , but they fear more that it wo n't pass . They feel like they have to have some health-care plan passed . And so I think they 're in a quandary . @!TARANTO : Well , it 's like that old joke about the guy that sees a bear coming . And he puts his shoes on . And his friend says , " Why are you putting your shoes on ? You ca n't outrun the bear . " He says , " I do n't need to outrun the bear . I just need to outrun you . " Obama is the bear , and non one wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one who is last in line . @!HANNITY : I just wonder if there was one Democrat . Let 's say Evan Bayh came out and said , " I 'm against the bribery , the process , the deal with unions and Ben Nelson and Mary Landrieu " ? He would -- he 'd be a rock star . @!SCHOEN : Very simple , Sean , any Democrat who did what you 're describing would be an instant national hero . @!HANNITY : I do n't want him to do it . Evan Bayh , just stay where you are . You may lose . Honestly . @!EASTON : He 'd be a national hero to a lot of independents ... @!SCHOEN : Even Bayh is a very good guy ... @!EASTON : ... but he would be demonized by the Democrats . @!SCHOEN : He has supported the health-care bill . @!HANNITY : He 's silent . He 's standing by as this corruption takes place , silent , when he should literally exert leadership . And he would be the beneficiary of a bold move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become a Republican . @!HANNITY : Yes , that 's true . @!EASTON : And he has n't been totally silent . He 's written about his ... @!HANNITY : He 's pretty silent . He 's accepted these talks . @!SCHOEN : He talked about fiscal conservatism , that he could get down the deficit . @!HANNITY : Yes . Words , just words . Just speeches . @!EASTON : And the op-ed pieces that no one ... @!HANNITY : Nobody reads . Exactly . All right . We 'll take a break . We 're going to come back . A lot more with our great , " Great American Panel . " Tuesday is going to be fascinating . We 'll have full coverage right here . Straight ahead . @!HANNITY : And we continue now with our great , " Great American Panel . " All right . So the union exemption , the labor loophole that , if you have a Cadillac health-care plan that was a product of collective bargaining , you 're exempt . Now , I guess the bottom line is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last segment or the prior segment -- if you help Barack Obama get elected , you do n't have to pay taxes . That 's a pretty good payoff. @!SCHOEN : Until 2018 at least , Sean . @!HANNITY : I 'm sorry . What 's a few years ? We 'll pay taxes for that decade , you know . Do n't worry about anyone else . @!SCHOEN : There 's a $69 billion hole , also , that we 've got to fill in the bill . We do n't know what it 's going to cost now . And we have a lot of questions , no answers . @!HANNITY : A lot of -- how -- look , backroom deals , no transparency , a broken promise on C-SPAN . And I 'm thinking , you know , when you 're going to bribe , you know , your supporters this way , what is -- the American people are not going to take this , especially in their current mood , Doug . @!SCHOEN : That 's exactly right , which is why across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial support in the Senate and the House in November . Massachusetts is obviously touch and go for them . The more substantial point . Sean , particularly with the president coming into Massachusetts , the entire base of support of the president could be put at risk if there 's a resounding defeat in Massachusetts . @!HANNITY : Well , I do n't even think it needs to be a resounding defeat . If it is even close in Massachusetts that is evidence that the anti- Obama - Pelosi-Reid-agenda mood in the country is real . If you had any doubts after New Jersey and after Virginia , those doubts will be erased . And I think every Democrat will fear for their future . @!TARANTO : Well , and if Coakley wins by a small margin , she becomes the senator . She 's the 60th vote . They could still get Obama care through , unless it spooks members of Congress . So if Obama care gets through , that mood is only amplified . Because They -- they 've completely ignored the message that the voters have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the Democrats political situation even worse . @!EASTON : Well , I 'm just going to say , on this union deal , Barack Obama said he was going to change politics as usual in Washington . And we 've come in and we see -- this coming on the heels of the Ben Nelson deal . For any day ( ph ) when he 's buying Ben Nelson 's vote . Now , he 's buying the votes of his favorite constituents , the unions . SEIU 's president is one of the most common guests at the White House . It 's just so obvious . And you say it 's not transparent . It actually is transparent . @!HANNITY : The backroom deal is not transparent . @!EASTON : Everybody is watching this go on . @!TARANTO : But the union deal is worse than politics as usual . Because the purpose of unions is to give workers an advantage in negotiating with their employers . @!HANNITY : Right . @!TARANTO : It 's not to give workers an advantage vis-a-vis everyone else against the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn all unions into public sector unions , where the people who the unions elect ... @!SCHOEN : It 's politics , Sean , rather than free-market economics . It 's government creating jobs , government negotiating with labor union rather than the private sector creating the jobs . @!HANNITY : Let me see if I can put this another way that maybe will resonate with people . Because if you are a small business owner , you did n't get the benefits of TARP . You did n't get any bailout by the government . If you -- if you did n't support Barack Obama , you 're not going to get any added benefit . You 're not going to have your health-care plans exempt from this excise tax . And I 'm thinking , so it really means that , if you supported the president , you benefit . We 're creating a two -- two-tiered system . We 've got the elites that support the government . They 're in the preferred class , and then there 's the rest of us @!SCHOEN : And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's maybe lost his job , maybe is having trouble with paying for school and retirement , he 's sitting there saying , " Why do n't I get bailed out ? Why do n't I get special breaks ? " @!HANNITY : Sure . @!SCHOEN : And how do I reconcile myself ... @!HANNITY : All right . Is there ... @!EASTON : I would say this . This is going to resonate with both parties this year . I do n't think this is just a Democratic problem . @!HANNITY : This is a Democratic Party . @!EASTON : It 's also a Republican problem . @!HANNITY : No , Republicans did n't buy votes . They did n't have the power . They were left out . @!EASTON : They bailed out the banks that get -- that get ... @!HANNITY : But they did n't have ... @!EASTON : That get people upset . Politically it 's going to resonate ... @!HANNITY : This is going to hurt the Democrats . It was the president that said they would be on C-SPAN . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making an important point , Sean . The Democrats have one argument : blame the Republicans . @!HANNITY : That 's not going to work . @!SCHOEN : No . It 's the only thing they 've got . @!HANNITY : Is Obama care -- now I 've been saying that this is -- I 've been saying this is a done deal on -- on health care . That the Democrats are going to -- they 're going to stay in that closed-door room until they get their deal . Fred Barnes had an interesting point . He said that , you know , he thinks that , with Robert Wexler leaving , the one -- the sole Republican that voted for it , he thinks it can be stopped . Real quick : do you think it can be stopped ? @!TARANTO : I think there 's a reasonable chance it can be stopped , which becomes a fairly significant chance if Brown wins next week . @!EASTON : They 're going to pull out all stops to make it happen . @!HANNITY : They 'll buy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it not passing than they are of it passing . @!SCHOEN : So it 's the very bad result if it passes . It 's the worse result if it does n't pass . They 're going to get something through , somehow . Watch . @!HANNITY : And it 's what we keep hearing . So it 's not going to be any different , basically , than what we 're hearing ? @!SCHOEN : Well , who knows ? They 're behind closed doors , and each day is a new outrage . @!HANNITY : I thought it was on C-SPAN . You mean it 's not on C-SPAN ? @!SCHOEN : Not on my TV. @!HANNITY : When you tick off Brian Lamb you 've got a problem in life . I mean , Brian Lamb not the guy that ... @!SCHOEN : Bob Edgar , the liberal Congressman from Pennsylvania , head of Common Cause , says what 's going on is outrageous . @!HANNITY : That is all the time we have left this evening . It 's going to be interesting week next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have full coverage . Have a great weekend , watch football . Go , Jets ! We 'll see you back here Monday . Thanks for being with us.

##4072573 GRETA @!VAN-SUSTEREN , HOST : This is a " FOX News Alert . " The news out of Haiti tonight is worse than we have feared . Thousands are dead . Survivors are buried . The world is racing to help , but the country is in chaos , and time is our enemy . Jonathan Hunt live at the airport in Port-au-Prince -- Jonathan . @!JONATHAN-HUNT-FOX : Greta , we arrived at this very busy airport many hours ago , and we have watched through the day as the cargo planes from all across the globe , including , of course , many U.S. Air Force C-17 's , have come and gone today , bringing in aid supplies and personnel . But I can tell you , Greta , we also spent a great deal of time beyond the confines of this airport , touring much of the city . And when you go outside of this airport , Greta , it is literally like going through the gates of hell . There are people outside clamoring to get in , clamoring to find any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting at the doors of this airport to get through . They are not being allowed to . And then out on the streets , Greta , is a scene of desperation . There is a degree of calm to that desperation right now , I should add , and that is very important indeed . But it is a desperate scene . We drove past a shopping mall , for instance , which was once , I would say , three or four stories , pancaked to less than one story . At 5:00 PM , which is when the earthquake hit , there would have been dozens , perhaps hundreds of people in that shopping mall . They are probably presumably all buried beneath the rubble . The same is true of so many buildings we have seen today . Thousands upon thousands are dead . Thousands upon thousands of bodies are rotting in the 90-degree temperatures that the Haitians are suffering through now . The stench of death is omnipresent as you drive around this city . The president , President Preval , I spoke to here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country is broken . His government is broken . Some of his own government ministers have died . His presidential palace has been destroyed . He said quite openly , We can not cope , we need all the international help we can get . It is coming , Greta , but it may not be quick enough . And when I talk about the calm desperation you see on streets right now , that is important . But I also have to caution that many Haitians are saying us to tonight that if they do n't get the water they need , they do n't get the food they need , they do n't get the medical supplies , the tents for shelter they need in the next 24 to 48 hours , this situation could become much , much worse very quickly . We have seen what happens in Haiti when violence takes over . That is a distinct possibility if the international community does not get the food , the water , the medicines beyond the confines of this airport and into the hands of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the problems is getting that airport open . I mean , even we circled for three hours today and could n't get in . There were planes stacked 11 high , circling . So the problem is cleaning up the runway , cleaning up that tarmac down in that airport . Is that being done to get those planes out so other planes can land ? @!HUNT : Yes . No , the airport is very much open Greta . You can see behind me some of the planes that are stacked up here . You can probably also hear them coming in now . Looks like another -- possibly another C-17 coming in right now . I think it 's another U.S. Air Force C-17 , actually . So they are coming in pretty much every two minutes right now . I think one of the reasons why some planes have had to circle , bringing in perhaps the media , those kind of charter planes , is that they are simply trying to get in as many actual aid planes as they can right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running of this airport pretty much . We 're told that they will be in 100 percent control of it by this time tomorrow . That will certainly help . It is already helping . It is a well-run operation here . But the problem , Greta , is not so much getting the aid here to the airport , it is getting it out to the streets . And I spent many hours out on those streets today , and I have to tell you I did not see one single instance of any kind of aid -- medical , food , water -- being handed out to the people . That is what they need . As I say , right now , they have some water . They have some food . They have very little medicine , though . And they will not have food and water much longer under their own volition . They need these supplies . They have to be taken out of this airport and onto the streets and into the hands of the people , or we will all be faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 48 hours ago -- Greta. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Well , I can tell you one thing , Jonathan . At 35,000 feet , there was a plane with search-and-rescue dogs in it , wanting to land that plane so they could look for people who might be alive in those buildings , those collapsed . They could not land today . And hopefully , that now they have gotten -- now they 're on the ground and looking for people because there are probably still people alive . Jonathan , thank you . There is no doubt that the large Haitian community here in the United States is facing hell on earth , waiting to hear if family members are alive or dead . We tried to get to Haiti today , as noted . We were there with Franklin Graham , Reverend Franklin Graham and his humanitarian group , Samaritans First . Now , our plane circled Haiti for almost three hours as we waited for clearance to land . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) You 've been to Haiti before . This is not now for Samaritans First . @!REV-FRANKLIN-GRAHA : No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started working in as Samaritans First . There are hospitals down here that we have sent doctors to , we send medical equipment , supplies . We 've helped to build hospitals here in Haiti . There 's great mission organizations , and one of the -- one of the key organizations is called the Haitian Baptist Mission . They have a hospital . They have agricultural projects . They do a lot for the people of Haiti . So this particular group is kind of our lead partner that we are working with , you know , for this earthquake . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Franklin , we 've been circling for a while , trying to figure out how to land this plane . But now the -- is it the U.S. who 's now trying to take over the airport ? Is that what we 're hearing ? @!GRAHAM : This is what we have heard , Greta , is that the airport is in the process -- the control is in the process of being handed over . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : From Haitians to the U.S. ? From Haitians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. military . We do n't know if that 's for a fact . But we do know that while we were in the hold , we had a search-and-rescue dog team holding above us . We had the management team of the International Red Cross holding under us . And none of us were given permission to move . The dog team , the search-and-rescue dog team plane , called and told Miami center that they were a search-and-rescue team and they would like to have priority . Miami called Port-au-Prince . Port-au- Prince said , Yes , you have no priority . You will be the first plane to land when we can land you . And we do n't ... @(CROSSTALK) @!VAN-SUSTEREN : ... actually can see that plane circling there . We can see it . If you look out the window , you can see the search-and-rescue dog plane . @!GRAHAM : Every few minutes , we were passing each other . So he has the same problem we have , and that 's fuel . We can continue this hold and then go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . And so we just made the decision , Let 's go back to Florida and try this again . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Samaritans First has a number of planes standing by , filled with supplies and cargo . They 're literally on the runways right now , awaiting clearance to land in Haiti . Meanwhile , in Haiti , the scene is nothing but grim . Our next guest says he should not even be alive . Emmet Murphy is an aid worker in Haiti . He joins us live via Skype from Jacmel , Haiti . Emmet , where were you when the earthquake struck ? @!EMMET-MURPHY-ADC/ : At the time of the earthquake , I was driving between Jacmel and Port-au-Prince . I was in the mountain , and it was a very strong -- ( INAUDIBLE ) strong wind , and the mountain started collapsing around me . And frankly , I 'm just lucky to be alive . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Have you accounted for all your friends , your neighbors , your co-workers , or is this -- I mean , are you still sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , right now , in terms of all my staff , they 're intact . I mean , I think the first -- our families are in good shape , and friends , as well , in Jacmel . Right now , we 're really focusing on emergency response here in Jacmel . There 's a good coordination . Compared to the pandemonium I 'm hearing about in Port-au-Prince , it 's more calm down here . It 's a population of 50,000 people , but we have immediate needs of search and rescue . We need at least 20 people . We need equipment . We need a couple doctors , surgeons , anesthesiologists to come and help us . But things are fairly calm , but we do need -- we have a lot of buildings collapsed down here . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : So I take it , with the buildings collapsed , there are people unaccounted for because that 's obviously , you know , been a lot of attention on trying to get , you know , even such things as the search-and- rescue dogs in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you assume there are people who are under the fallen debris in your community ? @!MURPHY : Yes . Yesterday , they found three people alive , but four people had died . The main problem out here is we do n't have the proper equipment ( INAUDIBLE ) a long list of items urgently ( INAUDIBLE ) to get people ( INAUDIBLE ) , but the clock is ticking . We know that there 's major needs in Port-au-Prince , and we do n't want to -- we know that there 's bigger people there , but at the same time , we -- the road is cut off . I had to abandon my car and come here , so nobody can get here . And I know there 's a major emergency in Port-au-Prince , but we also have all the challenges down here doing what we can . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Do you hear people in any buildings at all ? @!MURPHY : In terms of -- we have -- ( INAUDIBLE ) hearing the people . The fire department and the Red Cross are more directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the area . We 're mainly at the coordination site ( INAUDIBLE ) mostly World Food Program , UNICEF are coordinating food distribution , some hot meals . So not so much -- those areas are more in town , and a lot of the areas are cordoned off for safety . Buildings were still collapsing because of aftershocks. @!VAN-SUSTEREN : How about the hospital in the area ? Do have a hospital in the immediate region ? And is that -- I assume that 's overloaded , if you do have one . @!MURPHY : Yes , totally overloaded . Part of the building collapsed . As I said , we have a lack of doctors , a lack of surgeons , anesthesiologists ( INAUDIBLE ) urgently orthopedic surgeons . We do n't have that down here . The doctors that are here are overloaded . We 're trying to set up -- we 're doing some feeding for the injured there . But as I said , there 's urgent needs down here in the hospital . We do n't have sufficient -- medical equipment is urgently need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what -- antibiotics , bandages , the whole nine yards . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Emmet , thank you . @!MURPHY : OK . My pleasure . Bye-bye . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Up next , a packed " On the Record , " live from Miami . More video is coming in by the minute from Haiti . The pictures are nothing short of horrifying . We have the very latest . That 's next . And Haiti 's ambassador to the United States goes " On the Record . " Plus , back at home , the eyes of the country are on the Massachusetts Senate race . It is getting rougher ! And now Governor Palin is involved . But not in the way you might think . We 're back in two minutes . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : " On the Record " is live in Miami with the very latest breaking news on that earthquake in Haiti . Joining us live is Ambassador Raymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the United States . Good evening , Ambassador . @!RAYMOND-JOSEPH-HA : Good evening . How are you ? @!VAN-SUSTEREN : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you immediately ? What 's the first thing you want from us , what kind of help ? @!JOSEPH : Well , the first thing that I have asked- and I 've been to the State Department and put in some requests -- is helping with the communication . Secondly , helping securing the airport . Third , helping us clear the roads , the main arteries . And help with search-and-rescue missions because there are some people who are still in the rubble , and I - - we should do everything to rescue those that can be rescued still . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Ambassador ... @!JOSEPH : And ... @!VAN-SUSTEREN : ... and maybe this is a -- go ahead , sir . @!JOSEPH : Then I was going to say , food and water for those who are still alive . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Ambassador , when we had our disaster in New Orleans , we had our government -- we sort of knew who could be in charge , you know , and we could make decisions . What 's different here is that we almost in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over your airport or to help direct planes in or whatever . And yet your government right now is in such disarray -- your buildings are down , your president does n't have a home . Are those discussions you had with the State Department almost how much you 're willing to let us make decisions for you ? @!JOSEPH : Well , I do n't know about letting you make decisions for us . There are some decisions that have to be made together . The country already has about 9,000 troops and police of the United Nations . And in this situation , where our ministries are destroyed , where we do n't know where some of our ministers are , I think it 's called for -- call for us to ask ( ph ) ... @!VAN-SUSTEREN : So you do n't have any problem ... @!JOSEPH : ... and together ( ph ) . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : So you do n't have any problem -- you do n't have any problem , then , sir -- I mean , like , the best example , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your country , and you know -- and I assume the American people , the American government would love to come in and take total control and orchestrate the planes coming in and leaving , yet it is your sovereign nation . So you 're happy -- you 're content for us just to come in and to direct the airport in and out and get those supplies in . Is that ( INAUDIBLE ) @!JOSEPH : But this is happening . This is happening right now . Before , they could not land , and now the United States , with the Pentagon , with the help of the Pentagon , has come in and is helping us . And I 'm quite sure the government is going to accept some of the help . At the same time , you know , we still are a government . We can not totally give our sovereignty . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : You know , we look at these pictures , and I -- it 's just -- it 's -- the amount of suffering is just indescribable , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I feel pretty bad because in 2004 , when I went to Haiti for the first time after a 13-year absence , from the air I saw some big problems . I saw those matchbox-type houses on the side of the hills . And I wrote a piece for the then New York Sun , and I said , Port-au-Prince is a catastrophe waiting to happen . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : And indeed , it has happened . @!JOSEPH : I did not think -- I did not think about an earthquake . I was thinking about a hurricane coming in and just pulling down all these little houses by the hillsides . But it happened another way . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Ambassador ... @!JOSEPH : So ... @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Ambassador , thank you , sir . And you know , and I hope that we can help you . You know , I hope our country can help very quickly because this has to be fast help . Thank you , sir . @!JOSEPH : Thank you . @!VAN-SUSTEREN : Up next : Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson has been slammed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator from Nebraska , Mike Johanns , think about the sweetheart deal his Nebraska colleague cut with Majority Leader Harry Reid ? The senator is next . Plus : What else do we have to say ? Kiefer Sutherland , the tough guy from " 24 , " out in public , dressed in drag . We have the tape to prove it . ' 
##4072574 @!HANNITY : And tonight on our great , " Great American Panel , " she is a political consultant , fundraiser , and columnist for the Sun Sentinel . Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour is here . He was the national campaign manager for Howard Dean 's presidential campaign . Democratic strategist and FOX News contributor Joe Trippi is here . He is also a FOX News contributor , author of " The Promise . " Father Jonathan Morris is back with us . Guys , good to see you . Thank you for being here . All right . Well , interesting times we live in . Massachusetts , of all places , is in play . And by the way , polls show why Obama is not campaigning there , because he polls lower than Martha Coakley . Who would have -- who would have thunk it ? @!JOE-TRIPPI-FOX-NE : It 's that tough -- that tough a place right now . Even Massachusetts , Democratic stronghold , it 's a tossup . And just the fact that we 're even talking about it , is kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Democrat -- look , Joe , you are an insider 's insider in the Democratic Party . Why do you think , you know , after New Jersey , a big win in Virginia for Republicans , now this race is up for grabs ? What 's going wrong ? @!TRIPPI : Well , if I were the president or were advising him , I would advise him to go in . I mean , this whole thing is going to be about turnout . And there are a lot more Democrats in the state that are just not as interested . We 've got an intensity problem . There 's a lot -- lot of hype , of heat and intensity on the Republican side . So if I 'm Democrats , and I 've got the president 's ear , I 'm urging him to go in , because you turn up the heat on the Democratic side , get the turnout . That 's how you win this thing . @!NOELLE-NIKPOUR-RE : Well , I just think if it was Ted Kennedy 's old seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think this is why you 're seeing the polls in a dead heat . I mean , look at Rhode Island . You 've got Congressman Patrick Kennedy that 's going -- that 's got a 37 approval rating in Rhode Island , and probably there 's going to be a Republican , John Waltham ( ph ) , that will probably take that . So this is sending a huge signal . And this win , this win that we could have with Brown , will send a huge signal of what 's to come for 2010 for us. @!HANNITY : Yes . I think -- I think Coakley has also run a very poor campaign , and I think the Democrats will ultimately blame her and try and distance her from the president . But all the terrorists have left Afghanistan . They misspelled " Massachusetts . " We had this rough-and- tumble incident with her campaign manager the other night . But a plurality of Mass. voters agree with Scott Brown on Obama care . @!FATHER-JONATHAN-MO : I 'm not interested in parties , necessarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But . @!MORRIS : ... what I am interested in is principle . And what I see right now is a game change going on . And that is that people are saying , and people in Massachusetts are saying , " Maybe we need to reconsider the role of government in our lives . " And the people that are with Ted Kennedy , the good man that he was , I 'm sure , President Obama , suggesting in some way , right , that the government has more of a responsibility than we do over our own personal lives . It 's a game changer . @!TRIPPI : No , look , people are really upset at the ends right now , I mean , they just are . And Democrats are in . We 've got control . They 're upset at the banks . They 're upset at the government . They 're upset at Congress . They 're upset at Republicans in Congress . @!HANNITY : You missed the main one . They 're upset at the president , Joe . @!TRIPPI : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in charge . That 's exactly right . So that 's playing out in Massachusetts right now . And I think , you know , there could have been a better campaign run , but that 's beside the point . We 've got an election to win on Tuesday . @!HANNITY : He 's right here . What he 's saying is , is that people are rejecting the socialism and the weak defense policies of the president . @!TRIPPI : That 's not -- that 's not ... @!HANNITY : Read the polls . @!TRIPPI : Well , I 'll read the polls . @!NIKPOUR : Look at Obama 's popularity polls . They 're going down . They 're going down . And everyone else is in danger of losing their seat for 2010. @!TRIPPI : The numbers show ... @!MORRIS : I do n't know if you and the Democratic Party have ever heard of this , and the Republicans today are n't very good at this , either . But there 's a principle called subsidiarity . And that 's an ethical principle . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a lower level of government or society can do for itself . And what we 're seeing today is that people are saying , " My goodness , " that is happening ... @(CROSSTALK) @!MORRIS : Joe , listen ... @!TRIPPI : ... bad economy ... @!MORRIS : Who 's supposed to ... @!TRIPPI : If the economy turns -- if the economy turns ... @!MORRIS : You know who 's going to solve that ? Individuals taking personal responsibility for their lives and making a difference . @!TRIPPI : If the economy turns before November , these numbers start changing . If it turns before November of 2012 , these numbers change for Obama . Yes , the numbers are bad now . Unemployment is 10 percent ... @!NIKPOUR : Amen , Father John . @!HANNITY : I say amen , Father John . @!MORRIS : And then Joe . @!HANNITY : Can we talk about the Catholic Church wanting nationalized health care ? Because we 've got to have ... @!MORRIS : Let 's talk about it . @!HANNITY : I 'm a good Catholic . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it . @!HANNITY : We 'll come back . We 'll take a break . More with our great , " Great American Panel , " straight ahead . @!HANNITY : And we continue now with our " Great American Panel . " National Journal poll , most Americans would vote against Barack Obama one year into his presidency at this particular point . We 've got to look at the reasons for this . You know , for example , when George Herbert Walker Bush said , " Read my lips : no new taxes . " That was a major break in trust with the American people . Barack Obama says C-SPAN . It 's all going to be on C-SPAN . Major break of trust in my view . Quadruple the debt . Nobody thought we 'd have a president Mirandizing enemy combatants on the battlefield . Man-caused disasters , not a war on terror . It 's all led to a narrative that I do n't think Barack Obama can stop now . You see how he turns and regains confidence with people ? @!NIKPOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls , which is obvious that he 's ineffective . He 's ineffective in his policies when he 's trying to push through . He 's not even listening to the American people , some of which voted him in on what we really want . He 's so concerned about making history , especially with the health-care reform bill , that he 's not listening to the people . @!TRIPPI : No amount of spin by either side is going to change this . Real events are going to change this . He either -- the economy either turns , the policies start kicking in , people see benefit or they don't. @!NIKPOUR : He 's got to stop spending money . @!TRIPPI : No . Well , that ... @!NIKPOUR : He criticized Bush for spending ... @!TRIPPI : People are worried -- people are definitely worried about spending . But when you look at the poll and you look at this poll , you look deep down into the internals , and I did , 13 percent of the American people think they 're already benefiting from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whoa . Fifty-two percent say that his policies have laid the foundation for turning things around . If that 's true -- 65 percent -- if things turn , he 's going to benefit . If they do n't -- if they do n't ... @!NIKPOUR : These are the same people that probably thought he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize , as well . @!TRIPPI : Sixty-five percent . @!MORRIS : In the green room we were talking how politicians on both sides are not trustworthy , right ? Basically , generally . @!TRIPPI : Everybody believes that right now . @!MORRIS : The big problem with President Obama right now , I think , is a question of whether or not he can gain the trust of the American people . @!TRIPPI : Absolutely . @!MORRIS : One of the biggest things : the health-care debate right now . Do you remember when President Obama came out and said to the American people and to the religious leaders in general , he goes -- I 'm not talking about partisan politics . I 'm talking about principle -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government is going to go to pay for abortion , they are fabricating the truth ! Right now everybody in the whole country knows . Everybody knows in the Congress , on both sides , Senate , in the House , that the whole question here is there is major money that 's going to go to that . And that 's a lack of trust . There 's no character . @!TRIPPI : They do n't -- they do n't trust Congress . They do n't trust Republicans . Look at the polls . @!HANNITY : I do n't want to harp on one issue , because I brought it up a couple times tonight . But I think this is important . If I was advising the president , not that he 'd ever listen to little old me . But if I was around the president , and the president had made a campaign promise eight times that he 's going to put all the negotiations on C-SPAN , and then he -- where 's the trust and believability ? @!MORRIS : Absolutely . Absolutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campaign : we 're going to provide transparency . @!HANNITY : Well , where are the people around him , saying , " Mr. President , keep your word . Mr. President , you made this promise . Keep your word " ? @!NIKPOUR : They 're ... @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : No , he 's not . Not on this , Joe . Not on lobbyists , Joe . He put lobbyists -- and similarly , he signed a bill with 9,000 earmarks . He promised that would n't happen either . @!TRIPPI : No , look , he ... @!NIKPOUR : He has no credibility . @!TRIPPI : He 's been out there on economy , on health care , all these issues . What I 'm saying is we 're going to see how it all plays out . We 're going to see how it all ... @!HANNITY : Forget about that . Why wo n't he just put it on C-SPAN ? You 're -- look , I admire your skills as a political adviser . @!TRIPPI : I would put it on C-SPAN. @!HANNITY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't -- I do n't know the answer to that . And I 'm not going to ... @!HANNITY : And he 's hurting himself by not doing that . @!TRIPPI : I think that 's probably -- probably true . But my point would be that , in the end , we can all spin or -- you know , and talk about this all we want . It 's the economy , stupid . It 's going to either turn or it is n't going to turn . @!HANNITY : Well , when you quadruple the debt , you know , there 's got to be a lot of definitions of turning . Look , I want the economy to turn around . I 'm an American . I 'm worried about the 17 percent unemployment rate when you add in underemployed and those that have quit looking for jobs . Those are real numbers , real people , really struggling . So -- but I do n't believe we 're going to create jobs by spending our way , by Keynesian economics . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!NIKPOUR : And look at the new bank tax that he 's proposed . What about that ? @(CROSSTALK) @!TRIPPI : He 's taxing banks now ? @!NIKPOUR : Who 's going to pay for that ? @(CROSSTALK) @!MORRIS : In the end -- in the end , whether it 's the banks , whether it 's the issue of , you know , whether or not he 's being faithful to his word about C-SPAN , it comes down to trust . @!HANNITY : Has he lost trust , in your view ? Have you lost confidence in him ? @!MORRIS : Yes . But like Joe and I both discussed earlier , I have n't necessarily found a politician at this level that is worthy of trust of recent history . @!HANNITY : You did n't trust George Bush ? @!MORRIS : I would n't trust his judgment on all things , no . Whether or not he believes in what he said , I would say yes , he probably did believe in what he said . And that 's a good thing . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being with us . Appreciate it . And that 's all the time we have this evening . Greta continues with the news . We 'll see you back here tomorrow night . Thanks for being with us. ' 
##4072576 BILL O'REILLY , HOST : " The O'Reilly Factor " is on . Tonight . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : Today , I 'm also announcing an immediate investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) O'REILLY : American help on the way to Haiti , as hundreds of thousands of people struggle to survive after that terrible earthquake . But will the money get to the folks ? @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : I think it might be a little bit intimidating that you have a stick in your hand . That 's why . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Who are you to decide ? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : I mean , that 's a weapon . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) O'REILLY : Is the Obama administration , specifically Attorney General Eric Holder covering up for the Black Panther party ? It looks that way . A " Factor " investigation . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!OPRAH-WINFREY : A few weeks ago , I went to Copenhagen , Denmark . What a cool city it is. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) O'REILLY : And apparently , Oprah Winfrey loves the socialistic aspects of Denmark . The culture warriors have been investigating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin zone . " The Factor " begins right now . Hi , I 'm Bill O'Reilly . Thanks for watching us tonight . Another $100 million of American tax money heading to Haiti . And that is the subject of this evening 's " Talking Points Memo . The world is cringing , looking at pictures like these caused by that terrible earthquake in Haiti . No one knows for sure , but the death toll could top 100,000 . And right now , lives are in the balance as there are folks alive in the rubble . Already , thousands of American military are going to Haiti , trying to save lives , and impose some kind of order there . Today , President Obama pledged an enormous amount of money . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!OBAMA- : I 'm also announcing an investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts . This will mean more of the life-saving equipment , food , water , and medicine that will be needed . This investment will grow over the coming year , as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Clinton administration , the USA has given Haiti close to $3 billion in assistance . And billions more have been donated by other countries . President Clinton took a personal interest in improving life for the Haitian people , but he failed . And today , his wife knows the pitfalls of the Haitian situation . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HILLARY-CLINTON-S : We have systems in place now to be able to track the money , to hold it accountable , to look for results . We 're doing that across the board . I 'm revamping our aid system , so that I can look you in the eye and the American taxpayer in the eye and say , look , you know , I 'm not going to spend a penny unless I have some confidence that it 's going to go to the right place . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) O'REILLY : So why did Bill Clinton and everyone else fail in Haiti ? The reason is fairly simple . There is no central authority there . The police are corrupt . There 's no army . And many politicians are thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drug dealers , voodoo priests , or common extortionists . State relief workers give food and clothing directly to Haitians in need . Odds are as soon as the relief person leaves , a thug will steal the charity from the poor person . Block by block in Haiti , gangsters rule . And the people are powerless to do anything about it . If you fight the criminals , you and your family will be brutalized . So with the world now focused on a true humanitarian disaster , perhaps it is time to really help the good people of Haiti . And have the United Nations impose some discipline there . Yes , we should send aid immediately , but President Obama should not just promise $100 million with no accountability . Every dollar needs to be managed . And if that means the USA calls the shots , " Talking Points " says , good . And I believe the Haitian people would say good as well . The earthquake in Haiti rated 7.0 on the Richter scale , the same as the San Francisco earthquake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiti , as we said , may be hundreds of thousands . Infrastructure is the difference . And money can buy that . But not in Haiti , where billions of dollars have gone right down the drain . And that 's he the Memo . Now for the top story tonight , two other views of the Haitian disaster . Joining us from Los Angeles , Rick Grenel , who served as a spokesperson for four U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations . And here in the studio , Sophie Delaunay , a executive director of Doctors Without Borders , a charity that does extensive work in Haiti . So the problems in Haiti for Doctors Without Border , like in some sub Sahara African countries are enormous , are they not ? @!SOPHIE-DELAUNAY-E : Absolutely . And they were even before , actually , the earthquake because we were already operating three hospitals in Port-au-Prince , where -- and we were the only operator of free emergency health care and obstetric care ... O'REILLY : Now did you get hassled ? Did Doctors Without Borders personnel get hassled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that there is a very acceptance by the population . It 's always changing to operate in these volatile environment . O'REILLY : So they left you alone ? @!DELAUNAY : Well , we are working with Haitian people . So and we are working in some unstable areas as well . And the population and the patients that we are treating are also suffering from the violence . O'REILLY : But did the gangsters leave you alone ? @!DELAUNAY : Yes , of course . O'REILLY : Or did they try to extort money - no , not of course . I mean , I 've been to Haiti . And those people are rough people . They 'll chase you down if they can . @!DELAUNAY : No , we did n't experience this kind of problem . And at the moment our , you know , our core priorities are to provide medical emergency . O'REILLY : No , I know . Look , I give a lot of money to Doctors Without Borders . You guys do very , very fine work . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in a place where there 's no central authority . There 's just simply no authority there . @!DELAUNAY : Well , the main difficulty for us operating in this kind of environment is that we are kind of , you know , subsidizing the Ministry of Health because there are n't enough means . Because . O'REILLY : Right , you 're overwhelmed with the health problems .. @!DELAUNAY : The national staff were overwhelmed . The national staff is not paid properly . And therefore , sometimes they do n't show up to work because we collaborate with . O'REILLY : Absolutely . All right . @!DELAUNAY : So these are the kinds of problems that we find . O'REILLY : But you have n't been shaken down by the gangsters. @!DELAUNAY : No . O'REILLY : They have n't come in and stolen your supplies or anything like that ? @!DELAUNAY : No , we have n't . O'REILLY : All right , Mr. Grenel , with $3 billion since 1992 going into Haiti , U.S. Troops , plus all kinds of humanitarian aid from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing gets better there . @!RICHARD-GRENEL-SE : Well , it 's actually a lot more than $3 billion . If you look at -- the U.N . has been working on the Haiti issue since 1993 in some form or fashion . Billions of dollars have gone in there . For 17 years , we 've been trying to get this problem fixed . It 's a survival mentality . They 're still trying to feed people and clothe people and trying to get their survival rate to come up . We 've got a long-term problem here that now I think the American people are focused on . We have to . O'REILLY : Okay , okay . But I still do n't get , with all that money that 's gone into that island , it 's worse in 2010 than it was in 1992 . It 's worse . So where did all that money go ? @!GRENEL : No question about it . O'REILLY : Where did all that money go ? Why has n't anything gotten better there ? @!GRENEL : No question about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . is just as frustrated . Their last report , they were . O'REILLY : Okay . I got everybody 's frustrated . I got everybody 's mad . I 've got everybody knows the problem . Where 's the money ? Where 's the money ? @!GRENEL : Well , I think USAID has got to take control . They 've got to . O'REILLY : All right , you do n't know where the money is , Mr. Grenel . If you do n't know where the money is , that 's fine . But an enormous amount of money has gone to that island and it 's just disappeared . It has evaporated . Nobody knows where it is . That 's the problem . @!GRENEL : Exactly . The money is definitely unaccounted for . O'REILLY : Okay , see , that 's a problem , doctor . Because you need money . Doctors Without Borders needs money to operate . Okay ? People -- Americans are going to give money to Haiti . More than any other people on earth , we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I give it , does it get to the people ? Now through your organization , it does , correct ? @!DELAUNAY : Yeah . And I think it 's a very fair question . And I think every organization should be accountable for the money it gets and the money it spends in the name of humanitarian action . And that should n't be any exception to the rule . What I can tell you is how the money that we receive is spent on the ground . And historically , our policy has always been to operate on the ground in order to be able to . O'REILLY : Which you do n't deal with the Haitian authorities . You got in. @!DELAUNAY : We do , of course . O'REILLY : You do ? Now do you have to pay those authorities ? Do you have to give them money ? @!DELAUNAY : Well , we pay taxes like everybody . O'REILLY : So you pay taxes to the Haitian government ? @!DELAUNAY : We do . Yes , if we . O'REILLY : But here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pay our rent if we rent a house . O'REILLY : All right . @!DELAUNAY : We pay local taxes . O'REILLY : Sure , if you 're in a hotel and food . @!DELAUNAY : Absolutely . O'REILLY : But if you 're going there to help the Haitian people to heal their illnesses , why would you have to pay tax to the government for being there ? They should want you there free . They should be paying you . @!DELAUNAY : Well , you know , the thing is that in Haiti , the whole system has been relying on international assistance . It makes the economy . And I mean , people living there have to behave like normal citizen . Even though I 'm not a U.S. citizen , I pay taxes in the U.S. So it 's exactly the same . O'REILLY : Yeah , it 's a different situation though . @!DELAUNAY : Yeah , but . O'REILLY : And a humanitarian group should n't have to pay any taxes . @!DELAUNAY : But anyway , what is clear for us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S. population or from other countries . O'REILLY : Yes . @!DELAUNAY : . we know how it 's spent because . O'REILLY : And then , that 's why I give you money . @!DELAUNAY : And the drugs . O'REILLY : All right , I want to get just one more question to you , Mr. Grenell . You 're going to have a telethon , George Clooney , all of this . I think Americans should give money , but I think President Obama has an obligation to really stringently watch the $100 million that were pledged , correct ? @!GRENEL : Absolutely . There 's a glimmer of hope here , Bill , in this terrible tragedy in that Americans are now focused on this problem . And when we focus on a problem , we tend to solve the problem . I think USAID does a great job combined with our military . I think we can make a long term difference . O'REILLY : I hope so . @!GRENEL : If Americans can not only respond , but remember in a year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue to do more . O'REILLY : Yeah . We 're going to watch it very , very closely . I may even go down there . Ms. Delaunay , thank you . Mr. Grenel , thank you . And we have a brand new billoreilly.com poll question for you . Will you donate to Haiti ? Yes or no ? Next on the rundown , Laura Ingraham will react to the earthquake in Haiti . How much should we give ? And later , guess who 's sticking up for Harry Reid ? Does the name Bernie Goldberg ring a bell ? Wow , upcoming . ' 
##4072577 @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : We want our money back , and we 're going to get it . And that 's why I 'm proposing a financial crisis responsibility fee to be imposed on major financial firms until the American people are fully compensated for the extraordinary assistance they provided to Wall Street . @!VALERIE-JARRETT-W : They want to levy a tax on the liabilities of those banks , the large institutions , the ones that contributed most to the economic crisis , and also the ones that benefited most from the taxpayer dollar . @!THADDEUS-MCCOTTER , : It 's going to be more expensive for the consumer . You will see less credit and higher unemployment as a result of inability to get credit . Other than that , I think it 's a fine idea . @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BAIER : One Republican 's reaction to the financial crisis responsibility fee . Most people are calling it the bank tax . Here 's an example of one bank that paid back its funds . Goldman Sachs was loaned $10 billion , paid back $11.1 billion . So there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The auto industry loaned , as you see , there more than $81 billion , paid back $3.15 billion , still the U.S. government is owed $78.1 billion . The auto industry is not a part of this tax . What about all of this ? Let 's bring in our panel , Steve Hayes , senior writer for the " Weekly Standard , " Juan Williams , news analyst for National Public Radio , and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer . Charles ? @!CHARLES-KRAUTHAMME : This is being sold with incredible demagoguery as a payment . The president says I want my money back . In fact , the majority of banks have repaid . Some of the banks never received any of the TARO money , and some of them were forced into receiving at the point of a gun in the Bush administration . And , as you pointed out , the real delinquents here , GM and Chrysler , are not being asked to pay anything because of Democratic ties with Michigan and the UAW . Now , there is merit here if it were portrayed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , as a result of what happened in ' 09 and ' 08 , an implicit understanding around the world that the U.S. government will step in . So there is an implicit guarantee of their loans , which means they have preferential advantage in receiving loans because everybody understands in the end the U.S. government will step in . That might be worth taxing . It would be returning the favor . But , only if you walled off the money and you can kept it as a way to bail out the banks if they failed , the way that the FDIC imposes a fee on the regular banks that is set aside and held in case of a bankruptcy . But this is not how it 's portrayed . The way Obama is selling it , it is a punishment for old behavior rather than a fee that you would collect in return for a certain advantage as a result of what happened in 2008 and 2009. @!BAIER : Juan , one Bush administration official , Tony Fratto , said that this is a Hotel California tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never leave , for these banks that have paid up , they 've paid up , but they are still going to be taxed , and likely pass it on to consumers . @!JUAN-WILLIAMS-NEW : Well , the thing of it is it is such a small amount of money . Think about it for a second in terms of the bonuses that these banks and financial institutions have been giving out . It 's about , you know , the bonuses are , you know , at the moment , let 's say one percent of GDP , $140 billion dollars . What the president is talking about is a tax of about $9 billion . It 's not even a small percentage . It 's a minuscule amount of the bonuses . Now , he could just simply tax the bonuses . Maybe that 's what he should be doing . But I think the anger that he was expressing today , and I think Charles is right when he calls it demagoguery , but it is the flavor of the moment in American politics . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this idea it 's going to be passed on as we just heard passed on to the consumers and somehow constrict lending does n't hold water . @!BAIER : Steve ? @!STEVE-HAYES-SENIO : I will start with the second part first -- yes , it does . For every one dollar that banks have , they lend 10 . So if you are taking $100 billion out , that is $ 1 trillion dollars in lending that is not likely to happen . That is a problem as precisely the time that the U.S. economy , the world economy is in recovery . And it 's a problem at precisely the time that the president of the United States goes on television repeatedly begging the banks to lend . He is doing something -- if this were to pass , if this were to actually happen , which I do n't necessarily think it 's going to happen , he is doing basically the opposite of what he should be doing for the economy . But I do agree with Juan that this is all about politics and optics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want here is for the president to be on the side of the automakers and against the banks . It 's really that simple . And by doing this , by making this pitch the way that he is doing , you saw , the producers actually did a good job of laying out where the liabilities are . It 's the automakers that owe the money . The banks have , in many cases , paid out the money or paid back the money . There are banks here that will be taxed that had nothing to do with TARP . There are foreign banks that will be taxed on this . The president just wants to change the picture . He needs to be populist going into 2010 elections . @!KRAUTHAMMER : It 's all about the optics of the politics , because you have populist resentment left and right in the country . And this is a way that you would tap into it . But he is selling it -- it 's essentially a tax on the bonuses . It 's a tax because of the bonuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is saying that we are going to tax you . But , in fact , there would be a way in which you could explain it in a legitimate fashion . Nobody is talking about it . There ought to be a fee as a result of the implicit government guarantee , and this probably is it . But if it 's going to end up in the Congress , it 's going to be inflated . It 's going to be a heavier tax and it will be all about the bonuses . @!WILLIAMS : All the lobbyists are going to stop it in the Senate . If there is a populist heat here , it 's going to be reflected in the House . But I want to say Goldman had $250 billion in earnings . This tax would be 0.2 percent a year . It is no big deal given the amount of money these , I think , thieves on Wall Street have been , you know , sweeping in for themselves . @!BAIER : So you would like to call it a financial crisis responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all politics . I do n't think there is any getting away from that . But the idea he wants to collect for the government something back for the help we helped these institution stand up ... @!KRAUTHAMMER : He already got it . @!HAYES : He has already gotten it . @!BAIER : Could a deal to tax so-called Cadillac health care plan speed up work on a compromise health reform bill ? The panel will discuss that in three minutes . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!OBAMA : I know everybody in the media is all in a tizzy , all what 's this is going to mean politically . Let me tell you something , if Republicans want to campaign against what we have done by standing up for the status quo and for insurance companies over American families and businesses , that is a fight I want to have . @(APPLAUSE) @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BAIER : President Obama speaking to Democratic lawmakers up on Capitol Hill late this afternoon . There is a development , a tentative deal on one element of the negotiations between the House and Senate , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 percent tax . It 's in the Senate bill , the House members hate it , union members hate it . They negotiated from $23,000 per family , the taxes would hit plans that were $23,000 to $24,000 , a little hiccup in there that $1,500 of the plans for vision and dental just wo n't be counted , but they are still in the plan . We 're in the weeds but we 're back with the panel . Steve , what about this ? @!HAYES : That 's exactly what I want the federal government doing , you know , making the determinations of whether dental and vision are going to be covered . We have reached the point where this is so preposterous , the level of detail , the level of deal-making is so preposterous it should make everybody outraged . But , in a sense , it 's just a continuation of what we have seen . It 's just a different kind of deal-making . You saw the president making deals with big Pharma before you seen him making deals . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by the politics of how health care is being put together , you are going to be even more troubled by the politics of health care once it 's passed , because all of health care , the U.S. health care sector , is going to be determined by these kinds of political deals . And it 's , I mean , it is a tragedy for the country . @!BAIER : Juan , here is another dozy . The deal says exempt all union contracts from any tax from increase on the Cadillac plans until January of 2018 . So if you are a union member and you have one of these Cadillac plans , you do n't get taxed , but if you live next door and are not a member of the union and you have a Cadillac plan , you do . @!WILLIAMS : It 's ridiculous . I sit here as someone who thinks that the country needs some kind of health care reform , but what you are seeing there is just absurd . It 's ridiculous . And it 's just a face-saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have been at the White House , who said they got a better deal when they went up and talked to Pelosi and Reid on the Hill . And it puts the entire kind of jerry-rigged deal at risk , because I do n't believe the Senate is going to buy in unless they are going to explain to them how it 's going to be paid for . And if you start taking away things such as the tax on the Cadillac plans , well then how do you compensate for that ? Where do you compensate for that ? Now , president Obama ... @!BAIER : You increase the Medicare payroll tax . @!WILLIAMS : That 's exactly right . That 's the other idea that 's being discussed . But what that means is , you know , recently the polls have shown -- the Gallup had the polls going up a little bit for the health care plan , but if the seniors buy off , and that 's exactly what 's going to happen if you start attacking Medicare , the he says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult . @!KRAUTHAMMER : The hypocrisy here is really sad . This is the president who ran on a premise that he would bring new politics , where the special interests would not write the bills , where this would be a politics of the people , that there would be transparency . And this is the most corrupt , deal-swapping piece of legislation in memory . What you have is a bill being written by Democratic constituencies on behalf of Democratic constituencies . Here of course are the union members who are getting a break . And the biggest corrupt deal of all is what 's not in the bills . The biggest drain on health care in the country , huge , in the hundreds of billions of year , is the unnecessary procedures and practices as a result of illegal malpractice system out of control , defensive medicine . Everybody understands that . There is not a word about it in the bills . That 's because the trial lawyers own the Democratic Party . This is a bill where if you are a Democratic constituent like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if you are a trial lawyer , you get a break . If you are not , you pay for everybody else . @!BAIER : Steve , quickly , the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says we are going to do it until we get it right . The president today telling lawmakers I want to campaign on this issue . Boy , you talk about the specifics , it does n't seem like it 's a great political winner . @!HAYES : No , it certainly does n't seem like a great political winner . And increasingly you hear Republicans talking about campaigning against -- on repealing whatever passes . And there are Republican and conservative interest groups like the Club for Growth that are saying we want to make Republicans running for office pledge that they will repeal . @!BAIER : That is it for the panel , but up next , we will see how Americans are pitching in to help the needy in Haiti . @!BAIER : Finally tonight , as always , the U.S. is leading the relief effort for disaster overseas . Correspondent Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Haiti . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!BRIAN-WILSON-FOX- : Around this country , the American people are doing what they always do when there is a tragedy somewhere in the world , they are responding , each in their own way . Medical groups all over the country are packing up , preparing to send in doctors . These folks are from northern Virginia . @!ROD-HUEBBERS-COMM : We have some general pediatricians , some trauma pediatricians , pediatric cardiologists , pediatric kidney doctors . @!KAREN-CARR-COMMUN : Yes , we go down and provide surgeries and clean water and education and all those things . But sometimes it 's holding the hand of a sick child and assuring them that they are going to be OK. @!WILSON : It may have been divine providence that this team of medical missionaries from Chicago was already in Haiti when the earthquake hit . Mary Mulhall described the scene over a satellite phone . @!MARY-MULHALL- " LIT : It was devastating and awful , and the supplies were very limited and we were cutting up scrubs to use as bandages and tourniquets , and really just scrambling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are triaging the patients and knowing full well that many of them were going to die . @!WILSON : And as is always the case in such times , you can count on Americans who believe in the power of prayer . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : God has got this one under control . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : All I can do is pray . @!WILSON : Of course , it does n't hurt to back up prayer with a little old fashioned action . And in Bedford , New York , one fire department rescue squad is ready to do just that . @!JAMES- " ROCKY " -ROBI : When I saw the video of those poor people laying in the street , no medical attention , doing what they could to survive , and I have all these people that are trained and willing to go , they have been calling me on the phone . Rocky , are we going ? You damned right we 're going . @!WILSON : In Washington , Brian Wilson , FOX News . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!BAIER : The images out of Haiti are gripping . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will see a list of vetted relief agencies there . We 'll have continuing coverage from Fox . That 's it from Washington . Goodnight . '
