What they see is simply a mirror . @(Footage-of-Gabriel) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we watch little Gabrielle nervously resist the temptation to check out the toy behind her . @!Mr-LEWIS : ( Voiceover ) About 15 percent of the children do n't peek. @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) But most children do what little Gabrielle finally did . @(Footage-of-Gabriel) @!MORIARTY : ( Voiceover ) And now the critical part of the honesty test .

OK , let 's play with the toy . @(Footage-of-Moriart) @!MORIARTY : Is there any child that does n't lie ? @!Mr-LEWIS : Are there any -- I do not believe that we could find any child that does n't lie . I do n't think that exists . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Woman-# Woman 1 : Do n't turn around . Just -- stay just like that .

That 's when the religious group from Southern California came in , the Church Universal and Triumphant , C-U-T or CUT as the locals call it . CUT bought up thousands of acres of ranch land here in the Paradise Valley and then the members came , as many as 2,000 members , practicing a new-age ' doomsday is near ' religion led by a charismatic woman they called Guru Ma. @(Footage-of-Elizabe) @!BOWEN : ( Voiceover ) She 's Elizabeth Clare Profit and she married into the church , the church started by her late husband , a vacuum cleaner salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people , including Queen Guinivere. @!Ms-ELIZABETH-CLARE : And I anchor here my causal body of love . @(Footage-of-Bowen-a) @!Mr-PETE-STORY-@1Mo : The Crow Indians were kind of our allies , and this was Crow country . @!BOWEN : ( Voiceover ) Pete Story 's family has been in this valley from territorial days .
