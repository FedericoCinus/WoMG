Instead , her heart is broken now and forever , because each day will be another day that her Nellie will not be in it . <p> Nine years old Nellie was on her way to school . There were only two streets to cross and she had promised her mother that she would be careful . <p> She had the light , he had the light . Like her mother had told her do , Nellie looked both ways . Like the driver had been taught , he looked both ways . What she did n't do was look behind when she left the curb . What he did n't do was look down from the cab of the truck when he made the right turn . He heard something but made nothing of it . After all , how much noise can a small nine year old make when she 's hit by tons of metal . <p> The trauma doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but dead when the ambulance brought her in but they had to try , she was so young . Each physician had been exquisitely prepared through years of training to keep people alive when terrible events happened . All were unprepared when outcomes were poor , even when the outcome had little to do with them and all to do with what brought the patient to them in the first place . One after the other , all in green scrubs , they leave in silence . <p> Everyone in the hospital knows the terrible thing that has happened to this child . Only Mon Chow , Nellie 's mother , who speaks only Chinese and is new to this country , has yet to be told . She is at work in a factory and the police go to bring her to us . <p> Nellie had left this life for more than three hours before Mon Chow knew her child never made it to school . By the time she arrives at the hospital she knew something serious had happened . It was for us to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a child ; we feel helpless and desperately need to feel better . And one of us speaks the words to this mother that we are all saying to ourselves . " Is there anything , anything that we can do ? Just tell us , let us know . " She wraps herself in her own arms , the left across her chest , the right holding onto her shoulder , face buried in the crook of her elbow . She rocks slowly back and forth , uttering a low and continuous moan . And , in her silence , we hear Mon Chow 's answer ; " My daughter , my Se Chen , my Nellie , I want my baby back . I Want My Baby Back ! Give Me Back My Baby ! " <p> How she knew to come I do not know . She left Nellie 's classmates to be here with this child who will never know she came . Pamela Wong , young contained , speaks English with an accent . She lets us know she speaks the family 's dialect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met and yet they have always known each other . " I am Nellie 's teacher . I am here . " There is no touching , no move to be close . Only a quiet : a calm , a presence . We bring her a chair . She sits next to the grieving mother . It is through her that we talk and it is through her silence that we learn that the comfort we can give is in being , not in saying , except when there is no choice . <p> " You know this was a terrible accident . Nellie is still here . She will look the way you remember her . We had to put a tube in her mouth to help her breathe and now we have to keep this tube in for the Medical Examiner . We need you to let us know this child is Nellie . We can show you a picture , or , we can bring you to her " . <p> The teacher speaks to mother and then to us . " Not now . She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And you ? Then police tell us you can make the identification . " No words are spoken only the nod of her head . <p> A small room , a lifeless form on a gurney , completely covered with a sheet . The nurse folds it back , exposing Nellie 's head cradled in white . The only sign of what has happened is the tube in her mouth where the respirator was connected . We are all here in this little room with this little child who lies motionless , the teacher , principal , police sergeant and us . We ask the question that must be answered , even though the answer is known . " Is this Nellie ? " The principal answers with her tears , the teacher with a nod . The policeman writes in his black report book , " Pamela Wong , teacher of deceased , identification 11:15AM . " <p> " The eyes , they are open . " Pamela says . " There is a belief that this is a very bad thing . The soul is talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . If Nellie 's mother knows about this belief , it will be very hard for her . " The nurse reaches for gloves knowing the answer before asking the question . " Should we close her eyes ? " Again , a nod . The nurse gently closes the lids but they do not stay shut . Pamela Wong , standing next to Se Chen , places her hand on the child 's forehead , moving it slowly down , closing the eyes , leaving her hand in place . " Se Chen , you can be at peace now . There is no longer anything to fear . There will be no more pain . You are safe now . It is time to close your eyes . Close your eyes for you , close your eyes for your mother . Be at peace , Se Chen . Go on your journey to peace . " Her calm and steady hand moves with the rhythm of her words , giving comfort to this child . If only she can hear it , feel it . " Sleep Se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Our place is no longer with this child , it is with this child 's grieving mother . This morning she sent her Se Chen to school , now her child is in a white tiled room with all but her face covered by a sheet . Five hours have passed between then and now . She is ready to see her child and begin to say goodbye . <p> Author Affiliation 
##1000057 Nicole and I always said we had a lot going for us . <p> Nicole and I were like sisters . Neither one of us looked like the girls in the teen magazines , but we always said that we had a lot going for us . We had great hair , nice teeth , gorgeous eyes , and cute feet . So what if we were n't skinny ? We liked the way we were made . Life seemed so carefree until our high school years . It was at this time that everyone seemed so hung up on how they looked , and stuff that had never bothered us before now loomed up like a monster . Nicole and I had always had fun going into the petite department of our favorite store in the mall . We would hold up clothes and ask each other which arm the petite outfit would look good on . I remember Nicole asking me once if I did n't wish sometimes that I was skinny . My answer to her was : " And give up this beautiful body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your weight , do you ? " she asked . I did n't think much about it at the time , not until after Nicole started making excuses and avoiding me . I could n't figure out what I 'd done . I 'd call and leave a message , but she never returned my call . Nicole started hanging out with a new crowd , a " skinny " crowd . I told my mom what was going on , and she said , " Maybe she feels good hanging out with her new friends , and they 're helping her with her weight problem . Perhaps you should join them . " " Thanks , Mom , that 's all I need ; like I 'm not good enough the way I am . " I stormed out of the kitchen and cried myself to sleep . Looking at myself in the mirror the next morning , I saw that my eyes were almost swollen shut . I had messed up one of my best features-my eyes . I smiled to myself , saying , Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And looking down at my feet , I reassured myself that I did indeed have cute feet . It had been several months since I 'd seen or spoken to Nicole , so I was really surprised when she called me one Saturday night . She asked how things were going with me , and said she had been out of school for a few weeks . I asked if she was sick . " Nothing that 's contagious , " she answered . It was- so great to hear her voice again . I just wanted to reach through the phone and hug her . " My mom is gone for the weekend , " she said . " You want me to come over ? " I asked . " Duh , why do you think I called ? " she said , laughing . Nicole was watching for me by the window . She was wearing a huge blue robe-it must have been her mother's-and she had a towel wrapped around her head . There were dark circles under her eyes , and her face was really gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken over chips , a pizza , and a six-pack of soda . " Pig-out night ! I bet this will make you feel better , " I yelled , showing her what I 'd brought . " Great , let me at it , " she said , pretending to bite into the frozen pizza . " Still a greedy little girl , " I said , grabbing the pizza from her and heading into the kitchen to put it in the oven . " We need ice cream with lots of toppings , " Nicole screeched . " Well , you might look sick , but at least you have a good appetite , " I said , laughing . We wolfed down the pizza , and Nicole went on to eat most of the chips and the ice cream . It was hard to believe that she could eat that much , since she was so sick . All at once she got up and ran into the bathroom . She was coughing , and it sounded like she could n't stop . I called to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't answer , I went in . Nicole was kneeling on the floor and leaning over the toilet . There was blood coming out of her mouth . I tried to help her up . I could n't believe it , for when I put my arms around her all I could feel were bones . The towel slipped from her head , and it was full of hair . " What 's wrong ? What have you done to your hair ? " I asked , trying not to panic . " It 's all falling out , and my gums are always bleeding , " she cried , opening her mouth to show me her teeth , which were a yellowish-gray color . I felt myself getting weak , and I eased us both down to the floor . All I could think of was AIDS . " Who gave it to you ? " I whispered . " Gave me what ? " she asked , looking at me with eyes that no longer held any life . " AIDS ; it 's what you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to smile as she answered , " You nut , I 've never even had sex . No , it 's not AIDS . " My brain was screaming cancer , but I was too scared to say the word . The blood still trickled from her mouth , and when she tried to get up , she just crumbled in a heap . " We have to go to the hospital . " I was trying to sound calm , but I was shaking all over . I do n't remember the drive to the hospital , and when we finally got there , the receptionist did n't even question us . She immediately took Nicole and told me to wait . It seemed as though hours had passed before a doctor came over to me and said , " Nicole said you 're her sister , and she wants to see you . " The doctor opened the door to a dimly lit room . There were machines with different kinds of flashing lights . One was making a loud beeping sound . There were tubes and hoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were my sister , " she said softly . I knelt down by the bed and took her hand . I was crying as I asked , " Why did n't you tell me you were so sick ? " " I was too ashamed , " she whispered . " Ashamed ? You 're not responsible for getting sick , you goof , " I said as I tried to hide my fear . She was crying as she said , " Yes , I am . At first I just wanted to lose a little weight . The girls all took laxatives , so I started , but I was always hungry . I started to binge , then I would purge . I just kept it up , eating , then throwing up . " Her voice was weak as she went on : " I knew that if you found out what I was doing , you 'd tell my mom . Everyone kept telling me how good I looked . It just seemed like such an easy way to get skinny . Then my hair started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I eat , I have to throw it up ; it seems like nothing will stay down . I no longer have control over my own body . " " Well , you 're going to get better now , and I 'm going to help you . " I kissed her hand as I spoke . Nicole gave me a weak smile and said , " Remember what we had going for us ? Great hair , nice teeth , and gorgeous eyes . " You 're going to get them back ; you just wait and see , " I said , trying to swallow the lump in my throat . Nicole looked up at me , and it was as though we 'd never been apart . I had my best friend back . " You sure ? " she asked , as she closed her eyes . Nicole died that night , even before her mother could get there . When word got around at school about what had caused Nicole 's death , her so-called friends said that she must have overdone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thought she 'd found an easy way to get skinny . Some of us are not meant to be skinny . Now every time I look in the mirror I think about Nicole , and I 'm grateful for what I see , because it 's me. 
##1000058 Everyone thinks I 'm a good player except Travis , and now , thanks to him , I 've lost my confidence in me . <p> My hands were clammy as I made my way across the band room early in the morning of the first day of my junior year . Wow ! Am I actually shaking ? Get hold of yourself , Samantha , I thought . Why was I feeling this way ? I 'd practiced all summerI had even gone to three different music camps . You 're a good player , Sam . You sailed through that audition . I forced these thoughts into my head as I stopped and took a deep breath . Straightening up , I marched with purpose toward the list posted on the band room wall . There it was . Yes ! I did it ! I made first chair , I exclaimed to myself Only a junior , and I 'm the lead player of the trumpet section ! Thankfully no one else was around that early in the morning . That way no one witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to do handsprings , but I 'm not that coordinated , and I certainly did n't want to risk breaking my arm . After all , the lead trumpet player has to be in top shape for all the responsibilities of the marching season ! I floated around in sheer elation until later that morning when all the band members came wandering into the band room . Suddenly a certain someone caused me to come crashing back to earth . Travis Easton , a returning senior , sauntered over to the list posted on the wall . Ha ! I laughed to myself Look at him strutting across the room so confidently . He thinks he 's going to be first chair . I relished the look of pure jealousy that appeared in his beady little eyes the moment he saw that my name was on the top of the list . He came chugging up the steps toward me as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him . " Sam ! What are you doing in my chair ? " Travis fumed . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , Sam , this position is mine . You just had dumb luck during auditions . For one thing you 're a girl , and a girl ca n't be the leader of the trumpet section . The job 's too tough . It 's man 's work . " " I guess it 's not your job either , then . " I could n't believe someone could be such a pig , even Travis . " Funny . And another thing , the first-chair player will perform a solo this year during the halftime show of the homecoming game . I 'm the better player , and I will play that solo ! " Travis spat out that last part with such venom and authority that I instantly began to worry . What if he 's right ? My audition could have been just a big fluke . No , it could n't have been . I really prepared for it . Everyone seems to think that I 'm a good player . Everyone , that is , except Travis , and now , thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school are always hectic , but this year they were absolutely frantic . To prove that he was a trumpet stud and to earn the honor of performing the homecoming solo , Travis engaged me in a number of challenges . The challenge is a procedure in which two people perform various pieces for the band director , who then decides which of the two players is better . You really have to prepare for these if you want to stay ahead . On top of this , my class schedule consisted of a number of advanced classes that required a lot of hard work . I usually spent my lunch break studying or reviewing assignments for one or more of my classes . " Hey , woman ! If we were n't such good friends , I 'd be afraid that you were snubbing me . I called you last night , but your mom said that you were too busy to talk . What were you doing , practicing kissing your pillow ? Or was it your teddy bear this time ? " my best friend , Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors chemistry books . Tina can always make me laugh . " I could n't do that ! I might hurt my lips , and then Travis would become first chair . " " Sam , are you still worried about that ? Look , you 've already won two challenges . " " But he 's challenged me again , Tina ! " I knew I was whining , but I did n't care . The stress of the situation was starting to get to me . " And you 'll win again , " she stated loyally . " You 're great . You play all the time . These challenges should be a piece of cake for you . " Some part of me knew that Tina had a point , but the other part of me was beaten down by anxiety . " Tina , if I do n't win this high school challenge , how am I ever going to become a professional musician ? And I really want to play that solo during the homecoming game . I 'd feel just like a professional performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play that solo . If you relax and do n't stress out , you 'll be fine . You 're naturally a better player than Travis . " " I guess you 're right , but that 's another problem . I think Travis knows it too , and it really bothers him . I overheard him telling someone that he wants to major in music in college like his dad did . I bet the homecoming solo is really important to him or he would n't be acting like such a jerk . Maybe I should just lose the challenge . After all , he is a senior , and I 'm only a junior . I can play the solo next year . It might make it easier for me too . Last night I practiced until my little brother had to go to bed , and then I studied for chem until 1:00 in the morning . I 'm getting absolutely exhausted , Tina . " These thoughts stayed with me until the day of the final challenge , the challenge that would determine who would play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I approached the band room , and instantly my stomach lurched . He is good , I thought . As I watched him from the back of the room , my heart went out to him . I could see how intense he was . Winning this challenge was really important to him . He 's not really that bad of a guy , I told myself . We 've always gotten along well until this year . He deserves to play the solo . Hey , wait a minute ! So do I ! I 'm good too . I love music , and I practiced hard all summer preparing for the lead position . And Travis is wrong . Females can have leadership positions . My thoughts were spinning as 1 glanced at the clock . In a mere quarter of an hour Travis and I would face off for the coveted lead trumpet position and the honor of playing the solo part . My pulse quickened . My palms were so sweaty that it was hard to hold on to my trumpet . I was finding it hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I had learned at music camp this summer was how vital the proper breathing technique was to good performance . How was I supposed to beat Travis if I could n't even breathe right or hold on to my instrument ? Maybe I was n't so good after all . Or maybe Travis was just supposed to win . I stepped forward and took a deep breath . Counting to the beat , I hit the first note hard and strong . My gaze drifted upward as I belted out the song . Hundreds of fans cheered and shouted in the crisp autumn air . Goose bumps covered my skin from head to toe . When the last note had faded into silence , I marched back into position . Looking over at Travis , I saw him actually wink at me ! " Good job , " he whispered as we continued our homecoming performance . 
##1000059 BEING IN HIS BROTHER 'S SHADOW WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY . <p> Jim , with his crutches under his arms , hobbled down the hallway to his brother Mark 's room and knocked on the door . <p> " I 'm busy , " Mark snapped . <p> " I 'll take just a minute , " Jim responded as he pushed open the door . <p> Mark looked up from the computer and frowned . He was playing the game Earth Orbiter and did n't want to be disturbed . " OK , shoot . You have 20 seconds . What 's the problem ? " <p> " No problem . Everyone has signed my cast but you , " Jim said , holding out a pen . <p> " A masterpiece , " Mark smiled as he admired the soccer ball he 'd drawn on the cast . <p> " Thanks , " Jim said as he shifted his broken leg to a more comfortable position . " It 's boring just sitting around with this cast on my leg . " <p> " That must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mark said , looking at the cast . <p> " It was n't the turn that did it . <p> I ran over some gravel and lost my balance , " Jim replied defensively . Mark glanced up at the Clock . <p> " Wow ! Look at the time . I 've got ta go . <p> " How about showing me how to play Earth Orbiter ? " Jim asked hopefully . <p> " I have soccer practice now . Why do n't you go and see if your cyberpet is hungry ? " Mark said as he pushed his chair away from the computer . <p> Jim noticed that Mark left in such a hurry that he forgot to turn off the screen , so he sat down at the keyboard and watched the glowing monitor . The orbiter seemed to be suspended in space . He pressed the return key and the ship moved toward the docking bay . Working on the docking maneuver , he lost track of time and was startled to hear Mark 's angry voice in the doorway . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My computers off limits . " <p> " But you left the game on , and I thought it would be OK , " Jim replied . <p> " Well , it 's not , " Mark snapped . Jim went to his room and flipped aimlessly through the television channels . Reruns , reruns , reruns . He clicked off the TV later when he heard Mark bound up the stairs and slam the door to his room . <p> Jim hobbled down the hall to Mark 's room . On the door hung a sign that read " Enter at Your Own Risk . " Jim ignored it and knocked . <p> " I 'm still busy , " Mark called . <p> Jim opened the door and asked , " I just wondered if you would reconsider and let me play Earth Orbiter with you . <p> Mark deftly maneuvered the spaceship on the screen . " No , " he said , " I do n't have time to teach you . " <p> " Well , I do n't need your stupid game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . <p> " Well , life 's tough . I have a lot of responsibilities and little time . The weather report says it 's supposed to rain tomorrow , which means that I 'll have to take time to bag the newspapers for delivery before my soccer practice , " Mark stated . <p> The next afternoon Jim hobbled out to the front porch and found the stack of newspapers for Mark to deliver . Laying his crutches aside , he sat down by the papers . Maybe he could help Mark and give him more time . He picked up a paper , folded it , and inserted it into an orange plastic bag . Slowly the mound of orange bags grew . As he worked he thought about the computer game . I sure wish Mark would let me show him that I can be a good player . <p> Jim was almost finished stuffing the papers when Mark arrived home from school . He looked at Jim sitting on the front porch and then at the orange mound of newspapers all ready for delivery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes widening . " Do you have a paper route now too ? " <p> Jim tossed the last orange bundle into the mound of papers . " No , I thought you needed some help so you would n't be late to soccer practice . <p> Mark let out a low whistle . " Wow ! I do n't know what to say . " " Well , maybe you could change your mind about playing Earth Orbiter with me , " Jim responded . <p> " Maybe so , " Mark said as he loaded the papers into the car . " We 'll talk about it when I get home from soccer practice . " <p> At least Marks maybe was n't a no , Jim thought . He played with his cyberpet until he tired of it and then surfed through more reruns on TV . Finally he heard the car stop in the driveway , and he hobbled to meet Mark at the kitchen door . " Are we on for a game tonight ? " Jim asked . Mark nodded his head in agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You 'll have to memorize some of the actions to use for certain moves , so pay attention , " Mark said , sliding Earth Orbiter into the disk drive . <p> " The object is to rendezvous with an earth orbiting space station . We 'll see if you 're a good pilot , " he added , handing Jim a joystick . Jim watched wideeyed as a picture of the earth appeared on the screen with a spacecraft poised for flight . <p> " Hit the return key , " Mark said . <p> Jim pressed the key , and the rocket booster ignited . <p> " Wow ! " he said as the spacecraft headed skyward . <p> " You 've reached minimum orbital altitude , " Mark said . " You can pilot it now by using the joystick . <p> Jim pressed the stick to the left . The spacecraft turned toward the orbiting station . <p> " Hey , that 's pretty good , " Mark said in amazement , " or maybe just dumb luck . Now try to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . <p> Jim followed his brother 's advice , and the craft reached the second orbit . <p> " Now we 'll try to hook up with the space station , " Mark said as he maneuvered the other joystick . <p> Jim watched his brother carefully as he piloted the craft into the space station . He wanted to do it himself but did n't dare ask . When the shuttle docked with the station , Mark whooped , " All right ! " <p> " That was great , Mark , " Jim said with genuine admiration . <p> " Here , you try it , " Mark suggested , taking the spacecraft back into orbit . <p> Jim watched in amazement as the space station continued to orbit around the earth . <p> " That 's where you 'll try to dock , " Mark said , pointing to a port on the moving station . " You have to make an orbit change to rendezvous with the station . It 's tricky , so do n't be disappointed if you miss . " <p> Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Remember , go slowly and feel your way . " <p> Jim 's eyes never left the screen as he propelled the spacecraft along the lower orbit with the touch of a finger . <p> " Hit the return key , " Mark suggested . <p> Jim pressed return and found his spacecraft traveling in the higher orbit he needed for docking . <p> " Say , you 're pretty good , " Mark noted . <p> Jim continued to maneuver the spacecraft along the orbit until it approached the space station . <p> " Now , the docking is the tricky part , " Mark cautioned . " Want me to help ? " <p> Jim shook his head , feeling comfortable with his new role . For the rest of this game he was a space pilot . <p> " It 's not easy , " Mark cautioned again . <p> This is apiece of cake , Jim thought . Being copilot in his brother 's shadow was the hardest part . <p> Jim watched the spacecraft as it neared the rendezvous point . He rotated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mark gave out a low whistle . " I do n't believe it . Your first try and you 're docking like a pro . " <p> Jim beamed as he aligned the spacecraft for the docking port and carefully took it through the corridor . He piloted the craft into the dock hanger and then stopped its movement . <p> " Congratulations ! You 're quite a pilot , " Mark said as he stared at his younger brother . " Say , maybe we could do this often after soccer practice . " <p> Jim smiled . Being the younger brother was n't so bad after all . Maybe there would be more times like these that he could share with Mark . <p> 
##1000061 AT Christmas we went to my grandparents ' . <p> My grandparents lived outside New York City in a private park , a strange nineteenth-century hybrid between a club and a housing development . The park was enclosed by a thick stone wall , and at the entrance were a pair of stone gateposts and a gatehouse . As we approached the gate , a man would appear in the doorway of the gatehouse , sternly watching our car . Our father , who knew the gatekeeper , would roll down his window and say hello , or sometimes he would just smile and wave , cocking his hand casually backward and forward . The gatekeeper would recognize my father then and nod , dropping his chin slowly , deeply , in confirmation of an unspoken agreement , and we would drive through the gates into the park . <p> One year there was a new gatekeeper , who did not know my father . The man stepped out of the gatehouse as we approached and waved heavily at the ground , motioning for us to stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's new , " my father said , slowing down . " Never seen him before . " <p> My mother laughed . " He probably wo n't let us in , " she said . <p> My father pulled up to the gatehouse and rolled down his window . " We 're here to see my family , the Weldons , " he said politely . " I 'm Robert Weldon . " My father looked like his father : he had the same blue eyes , the same long , straight nose , and the same high , domed forehead . The gatekeeper glanced noncommittally at the car and then he nodded . He was still frowning , but now in a private , interior way that no longer seemed to have anything to do with us . He gave us a slow wave through the gates ; then he went ponderously back into the little house . <p> The four of us children sat motionless in the back . After our mother had spoken , we had fallen silent . Our faces had turned solemn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our knees matched . Our docile hands lay in our laps . We were alarmed . <p> We did not know why some cars might be turned away from the park gates . We had never seen it happen , but we knew that it must happen ; why else would the gatekeeper appear , with his narrowed eyes and official frown ? We knew that our car did not look like our grandparents ' car , or like any of the other cars that slid easily between the big stone gateposts without even slowing up . Those cars were dark and sleek . They looked fluid and full of curves , as if they had been shaped by speed , though they always seemed to move slowly . Those cars were polished : the chrome gleamed ; the smooth , swelling fenders shone ; and the windows were lucid and unsmudged . Those cars were driven sedately by men in flat black hats and black jackets . The drivers nodded to the gatekeeper . The passengers , who were in the back seat , never in the front next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove through the gates . <p> Our car , however , was a rickety wooden-sided station wagon , angular , high-axled , flat-topped . The black roof was patched , and the varnished wooden sides were dull and battered . Our car was driven by our father , who did not wear a black jacket , and next to him in the front seat was our mother . The two slippery brown back seats were chaotic with suitcases , bags of presents , the four of us children , and our collie , Huge . We felt as though we were another species when we arrived at this gate , and we wondered whether we would be turned away . The rules of entry and exclusion from the park were mysterious to us ; they were part of the larger , unknowable world that our parents moved through but that we did not understand . Fitting in was like the struggle to learn a language-listening hard for words and phrases and idioms , constantly mystified and uncomprehending , knowing that all around us , in smooth and fluent use by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system we could not yet grasp . <p> After we were through the gates that day , my mother turned to us . <p> " Well , we made it , " she said humorously . " They let us in this time . " She smiled and raised her eyebrows , waiting for us to answer . My mother was small and lively , with thick lightbrown hair parted on one side and held with a barrette . She wore her clothes casually , sweaters and long full skirts . <p> We said nothing to her . We disapproved of my mother 's levity , all of us : Sam and Jonathan , my two older brothers ; Abby , my older sister ; and me , Joanna . I was the youngest , and the most disapproving . <p> Inside the gates the road meandered sedately through the park , on the slopes of a small , steep mountain . Up on the top , along the ridge , the land was still wild and untouched . Deer moved delicately through the thickets , and we had heard stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down along the narrow paved roads all was mannerly , a landscape of wide snowy lawns , graceful flowering trees and towering shade trees , now all winter-bare , and luxuriant shrubberies mantled with snow . Unmarked driveways slid discreetly into the road 's docile curves . Set far back , even from this private road , were the houses : tall , ornate , gabled and turreted , half hidden by brick walls , stonework , and the giant old trees that surrounded them , they stood comfortable and secure within their grounds . <p> Our grandparents ' house was called Weldonmere . It was set below the road , at the bottom of a wide , sloping oval of lawn . The driveway traced a long semicircle , swooping from one corner of the front lawn down to the house , at midpoint , and then back up to the road again . Along the road stood a screen of trees : dogwoods , cherries , and an exotic Japanese maple with small , fine-toothed leaves , astonishingly purple in the summer . Down the hill , protecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beech , dark and radiant . Its dense branches , like a vast layered skirt , swept down to the lawn , and beneath them were deep , roomy eaves , where we played in the summer . <p> Weldonmere was white , with pointed Victorian gables and round neoclassical columns . At the front door was a big portecochere , and above it the house rose three stories to the scalloped blue-black slates of the roof . <p> MY father stopped the car under the porte-cochere , and we cascaded out . Huge darted alertly into the bushes , his long nose alive to a new universe . We children , following our parents through the brief shock of cold air , clumped noisily into the big square front hall . We stood among the suitcases on the Turkey carpet , blinking in the light of the chandelier . Our parents called out in a general and celebratory way . <p> " Well , hello ! You 're here ! " Grandpere appeared in the doorway to the living room . Grandpere was tall and dignified , with a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer , which he had been , or a rider , which he still was . About him was an air of order . He was always in charge . Grandpere carried his gold watch on a chain in his pocket , and he wore a waistcoat , which was pronounced weskit . He was a formal man , courtly but kind . Underneath the moustache was always the beginning of a smile . <p> " Hello , Robert ! Sarah , children . " His voice was deep , his manner ceremonial . He included us all in his smile , and he opened his arms in a broad welcoming gesture . <p> Grandmere appeared behind him . Grandmere was narrow and elegant . She wore a long dark dress , and her white hair was parted on the side . It started straight and then turned to dense , regular curls , pressed flat against her head . Her mouth was eternally bowed in a gentle smile . Grandmere was from Charleston , South Carolina , but her mother 's family had been from Baton Rouge , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that English was common , which was why we called our grandparents " Grandpere " and " Grandmere . " <p> " Here you all are , " Grandmere said faintly . She sounded pleased but exhausted , as though we were already too much for her . She stood gracefully in the corner of the arched doorway , leaning her hand against it and smiling at us . We milled around , taking off our coats and being kissed . <p> Huge had come inside , and now held his plumy tail tensely up in the air , his head high and wary . Tweenie , Grandmere 's horrible black-and-white mongrel , snake-snouted , sleek-sided , plump , and disagreeable , appeared in the doorway behind her . The two dogs approached each other , stiff-legged , slit-eyed , flat-eared . They began to rumble deep in their throats . <p> " Now , Tweenie , " Grandmere said , not moving . <p> " Oh , gosh , " my father said from the other side of the hall . " Get Huge , will you , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all took responsibility for our beloved Huge . We all began shouting , and pummeling his solid , lovely back , sliding our hands proprietarily into his feathery coat . " Huge ! " we cried , sternly reminding him of the rules , and demonstrating to the grown-ups our own commitment to them . Of course , this was hypocritical . We believed that Huge could do no wrong and was above all rules , and that Tweenie was to blame for any animosity-in fact , for anything at all . We thought that Huge was entirely justified in entering Tweenie 's house and attacking her , if he chose to do so , in her own front hall , like some Viking raider . Huge ignored our calls to order , shaking his broad brown head , his eyes never leaving Tweenie 's cold stare . I laid my head against Huge 's velvet ear . <p> " Huge , " I said , holding him tightly around the neck , " no growling . " <p> We did not touch Tweenie : she had been known to bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said firmly , " Tweenie , come here . " <p> The authority in his voice quieted us all . Tweenie paid no attention , but Grandpere strode across the rug and took her powerfully by her wide leather collar . Tweenie 's growls rose suddenly in her constricted throat , and she twisted her head to keep Huge in sight as she was dragged away . <p> " Oh , dear , " Grandmere said gently . " Tweenie gets so upset by other dogs . " <p> Huge , unfettered and unrepentant , trotted triumphantly in small , swift circles on the rug , his tail high . <p> " Huge , " I said sternly , and banged on his back . I looked at my father for praise , but he was making his way toward us through the luggage . When he reached us , he grabbed Huge 's collar . <p> " Now calm down , " my father said sharply to Huge . Huge , who had never been trained in any way , ignored my father completely . My father pulled him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting his great shaggy body to get a last view of Tweenie 's smooth , repellent rump . Tweenie was being slid unwillingly , her feet braced , past the front stairs and past the little closet where the telephone was , through the small door behind the staircase which led into the kitchen quarters . <p> Grandpere opened the door . " Molly , " he called , " take the dog , will you ? " Without waiting for a reply he closed the door behind Tweenie and returned to us , brisk and unruffled . <p> " She gets upset , " Grandmere murmured again , smiling at us in a general way . <p> " We 'll take Huge up with us , " my father said . " Let 's get settled now-let 's get our things upstairs . " <p> We set off . The staircase was wide and curving , with a heavy mahogany rail and carved banisters . The steps were broad and shallow , and the red-patterned carpeting was held in place by brass rods . Lugging our suitcases behind us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the second-floor landing was a door that was always closed . <p> ONE afternoon I had climbed the stairs by myself . When I reached that landing , instead of going on to the upstairs hall I stopped at the door and opened it , though I knew I should not . I looked in : a narrow hallway , with closed doors on either side . I stepped inside . It was hushed and dim ; everything seemed different there . The ceiling was lower ; the carpet was plain green and thin underfoot . I walked silently , on my toes , down the hall . I pushed open one of the doors and peered into a small bedroom . It held a painted wooden bed , a modest bureau , and a chair . Everything was perfectly neat . The window looked out the back of the house to the garage . The curtains at the window were limp , and the air seemed muted and dark . A clock ticked in the stillness . I stood without moving , looking at everything , staring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pound , and when I heard someone coming up the back stairs from the kitchen , I fled to the front landing . <p> Later I asked my mother what was behind that closed door on the landing . She said it was the servants ' wing , and that we must never go in there , because it would disturb them . That was where they lived , she said . I did n't understand this : how could you live in a place like that ? How could a whole life be compressed into that small room with nothing in it , in someone else 's house ? <p> We had no servants in our own house . My father had been a lawyer in New York , like Grandpere , but he had given that up . He had left the law and the city , and moved to Ithaca in upstate New York , where we now lived . My father worked for the university , helping poor people in the community . I 'd heard him tell people about this change , and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual , and that we were proud of it . <p> We lived outside town , in an old white-clapboard farmhouse . We had only one bathroom , and the house was heated by a big wood-burning stove in the middle of the living room . In the winter , after supper , we sat around the stove and my mother read out loud . While we listened , my father peeled oranges for us , pulling them apart , separating the succulent crescents and passing them to us , fragile and treasured . Then he would unlatch the heavy iron hatch on the stove and throw in the thin , bruised-looking orange peels . We heard the faint hiss as they gave themselves up to the red heart of the stove . We closed our eyes for a moment , listening , and feasting on the sweet fragrance of the peels . <p> At Weldonmere we slept on the third floor , Abby and I in one room , the boys in another . Our room overlooked the portecochere , and it had been our father 's when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , and an engraving of a Raphael Madonna and child , in velvety blacks . The boys ' room overlooked the back lawn and , beyond it , the small pond that gave the house its name . Our parents slept on the second floor , with Grandmere and Grandpere . We children were alone on the third floor , and we liked this . On Christmas Eve we felt boisterous and wild , and we did n't want the presence of our parents to constrict us . In the morning we were not allowed to go down the front stairs for our stockings until it was light , and on some Christmas mornings the four of us had sat lined up and silent on the landing , shivering , waiting for the first gray pallor of day to lighten the darkened rooms below . <p> THIS Christmas we had arrived late . The drive was a long one , and by the time we got there , Grandmere and Grandpere had already had dinner . Our parents were to have trays in front of the fire in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Molly would give us something to eat . <p> Molly was Irish and fierce , with pale-blue eyes and a thick cloud of white hair . She had slim arms and slim legs , and a thick middle . Her hands and feet were small , and she moved fast . She wore a white uniform , a white apron , and white stockings , and lace-up shoes with thick low heels . She ruled the kitchen absolutely . We never did anything to make Molly mad . She would have our heads . That 's what she told us , shaking her own wild white head fiercely , and we believed her . <p> Molly had a husband named Bud , but he was a mysterious figure , like the bobcats ; we had never seen him . We did know Molly 's son , Richard , who was my grandparents ' chauffeur . He was fat , and moved slowly . We children had a poor opinion of him . We called him Ree-ard , which we thought was funny . When he was n't driving my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair in the kitchen , near the back stairs . He took off his black coat and sat in his shirtsleeves , his white shirt vast and billowy . He looked like a lump , and sometimes Molly told him that , rounding on him suddenly from the big stove and laying into him without mercy . Molly might do that at any moment to anyone-erupt into a high , foamy rage , and say things with her fierce , thin Irish lips that you never wanted to hear . <p> IMG 
##1000062 Sometimes , even the most cautious investor can be deceived . But , with persistence and an auditor 's edge , the truth can be unearthed . <p> LUKE AND BERT WERE PARTners in a $4 million sportinggoods business . For the first 20 years , the business was very successful , but in the last three years , sales had decreased and margins dwindled . To help alleviate the decline in cash flow , the company 's attorney suggested that the owners look for a third partner who could invest s2oo , ooo and possibly add some management skills to complement the areas in which the others were weak . Across town , Ed heard about the sporting-goods opportunity through an attorney in the law firm where he worked as an accountant and thought it sounded like exactly what he was looking for . But because Ed had once been an internal auditor , his instincts told him to analyze this opportunity in detail before investing . Ed spent hours poring over the company 's reports . Although there were no audited statements , Luke and Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reviews prepared by a certified public accounting firm . Ed was also given copies of the business " tax returns for the last four years . While reviewing the documents , he noticed that one of the company 's largest assets was its inventory . When Ed met with the engagement partner of the CPA firm , he was assured that physical inventory tests were performed each year . Nevertheless , Ed asked for-and received-representation letters signed by both Luke and Bert attesting to the values of the inventory . After completing due diligence , the sale closed two months before the company 's fiscal year-end . Ed rolled up his sleeves and jumped into the business . He was working 6o-plus hours every week trying to learn everything about the business as quickly as he could . He knew it would take all the energy he had to turn this business around , but he was willing to make the effort . Although Ed 's expertise was in finance , Bert had been the company 's chief accounting officer for io years and was reluctant to turn that role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ed concentrated on other areas such as human resources , training , and merchandising . Even though he was not in charge of the books , Ed began to notice some alarming discrepancies . He first became troubled when he realized that the company was inadequately prepared for its year-end inventory . No attempt had been made to relieve the general chaos of the merchandise ; count sheets were used , but areas were n't straightened up and like-items were n't grouped together . The physical inventory began when the business closed and lasted until the final item was counted-eight hours later . Every employee was expected to participate-at time and a half -- and temporary employees were hired from an agency . During the recount phase , Ed found one section that had been missed with more than $3,000 worth of product and another section with several empty product boxes . When the results of the inventory were tabulated , shrinkage was calculated at more than zo percent of the total inventory of $975 , ooo . That loss amounted to more than $200,000 , which more than wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , not to mention any profit for the year . Ed was not just uneasy ; he was thoroughly confused . Because Ed had been an auditor , he was well-equipped to investigate the problem . He drew up an audit program to reconcile the inventory . Choosing high-dollar items , he began reconstructing the inventory . He used the prior year 's physical inventory report and traced purchases and sales in and out of the warehouse , reconciling each item to the report . One thing became evident early on-there were too many journal entries that showed increased physical unit counts at month-end . Because Bert was in charge of the financial aspects of the business and ultimately responsible for journal entries , Ed discussed the discrepancies with Luke first . Luke disavowed any knowledge of the fictitious entries , so Ed went to the accounting clerk who made the entries . She told him that she was only acting upon Bert 's instructions . According to her , Bert had falsified the inventory report so that it appeared to the bank as if there were enough merchandise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount , Bert " invented " some to cover the covenant amount . If a bank auditor came in to check , Bert had a supply of empty product boxes that he could put on the shelf . Apparently , the bank 's auditor only counted boxes : He never opened or lifted any of them . Finally , Ed confronted Bert with the evidential material that he had gathered . At first , Bert denied all knowledge of the fraud . But because Ed had the facts to back up his assertions , Bert confessed that not only had he falsified the inventory , he 'd been doing it for a number of years . Bert admitted that the company had not been profitable for more than six years , and he had been falsifying inventory so it looked as though there was moderate income . It started because the company had a oneyear loss of around $30 , ooo and Bert was afraid that the bank would close them down . He began fabricating inventory , always thinking that the company would be able to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Because Bert had intentionally defrauded the new partner , Ed had Bert sign a waiver of rights against the company and its officers . Ed also asked for and received Bert 's resignation . Although he was unable to prove that the CPA firm was involved in the commission of the fraud , Ed had his suspicions . At best , the firm was negligent in the observation of the physical inventory . Ed discussed the problem with the firm 's engagement partner , and received the company 's withdrawal from the engagement as well as a refund of all monies paid them during the last two years . When Ed talked to the bank 's officials , they chose to change the covenants and allow Ed and Luke to work out the loan over an extended period of time rather than close the business and suffer the loss . The two new partners continued to run the business in a declining marketplace , but they were able to turn it around through cost-cutting measures . Eventually , Ed and Luke had an opportunity to sell the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his investment , too . LESSONS LEARNED * If top management is unprincipled , it is very difficult to conduct due diligence. * Audit tools are useful even to managers . * Cursory inventory observations are next to worthless . Boxes must be opened and product examined to ensure it matches the description . * If something makes you uncomfortable , do n't hesitate to investigate further . * Make sure you have all the facts before confronting someone you suspect of falsifying information . * Fraud perpetrators and those involved with a fraud may provide restitution .

##1000065 The year is 2028 . In a world still as dangerous as ever , airborne assault finally has supplanted amphibious operations as the primary means of projecting U.S. power abroad . The man who did the most to make this new warfighting strategy a reality speaks out about why and how it happened . <p> As late as the first decade of this century , the U.S. Marine Corps possessed a formidable amphibious warfare capability . Today , except for small-scale raids and stratagems , the Corps no longer embraces over-thebeach assault warfare . Many attribute the end of this NavyMarine Corps specialty to Army Lieutenant General Barry H. Smith . General Smith graduated from West Point in 1979 . He went on to lead an Army battalion in the assault on Gabes during the Tunisian conflict of 2002 . As a general officer , he led airborne divisions in the Second Gulf War and the South China Sea crisis . The record of his XVIIIth Airborne Corps " operations in the recent invasion of Yemen speaks for itself , and was a fitting end to a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the primary means to gain entry into a hostile country . Throughout his career , General Smith advocated a radical concept for forced entry by the Army-Air Force team that many say made traditional Navy-Marine Corps amphibious operations obsolete . Now retired , General Smith graciously allowed this interview to answer charges that it was his advancement of the Army 's XVIIIth Airborne Corps that relegated 20th-century-style amphibious operations to the history books . Editor : General , let 's start back in 2002 with the Tunisian conflict , since that seems to be the point where airborne operations began to eclipse amphibious methods of forcible entry . Why did the military use elements of the 82nd Airborne Division to recapture the port of Gabes in a scenario that seemed a textbook case for the Navy and Marine Corps amphibious ready groups ( ARGs ) ? Surely , the Marines easily could have handled the Libyan force that occupied the port . General Smith : Believe me , that one caught me by surprise as much as it did the Marine Corps . The Navy and Marine Corps had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a flare-up in Somalia ; an exercise in Lithuania ; a group standing off Yemen because of the demonstrations that ultimately resulted in the IranYemen Cross-Strait Alliance ; another Nigerian evacuation operation preparing to go ; and a possible evacuation operation in Bosnia . They the Navy and Marine Corps tried to pony up , but for the first time they found something had to give . They wanted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to advance the turnaround of the next-to-deploy units and emergency deploy the next ARG ahead of schedule . I tip my hat to their can-do attitude , but the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense would not allow it because of personnel tempo restrictions . Besides , the operation had to go down in a week-too soon for the ARG to make the transit . So the Joint Chiefs told the Army , " You said you can move that airborne army of yours anywhere , anytime . Make good on it ! " My infantry battalion was part of a brigade the 82nd dropped in the Libyan rear behind Gabes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the port-long before our initial air-dropped supplies ran out . Once the port was open , the Navy supplied us for the next two months . The Navy 's maritime support gave the operation indefinite staying power . When the accord was signed , we all went home . Editor : And it worked just like that ? Smith : Oh , there were problems , but we worked them out . The biggest was the airlift organization . As you know , the C-130s and C-5s loaded the 82nd in North Carolina . It took a lot of coordination with the Air Force ; in fact , I would say they scrambled more than anyone . But teamwork , joint training among the officers in charge , and understanding other services made it possible . On the sixth day , after a good night 's rest , the " All Americans " had breakfast in Fort Bragg and lunch in Tunisia . Editor : Fair enough . Let 's move on to technology and revolutions in military affairs ( RMAs ) . You argue that your RMA in parachuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please explain . Smith : By the turn of the century , we were pretty far along in our ability to air drop battalions and brigades , even divisions . In this century 's first decade , small RMAs in airborne warfare gave the Army a cost advantage . Editor : Such as ? Smith : The Air Force built its C-17 , which gave it longer legs , shorter takeoff and land capability , and a heavier lift capacity . The same innovations were incorporated into the modified C-Ss . Because industry had the tooling and benches for these aircraft , production was relatively inexpensive . So we made many more of them . In addition , drop capabilities advanced . By 2012 , with Global Positioning System guiding vanes , gyro stabilization , and precision-guided heavy parachute pallets , we were dropping MIAl Abrams tanks , 155-mm howitzers , munitions , and supplies from 40,000 feet and placing them exactly where we wanted them . We would design templates tailored to the terrain and enemy positions , drop the force according to the templates , and within three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective . These innovations were relatively inexpensive compared to what the Navy and Marine Corps needed to continue with amphibious warfare . Back in the late 1990s they had their advanced amphibious assault vehicle , the DD-21 , precision gunfire munitions , ship construction and modernization , the MV-22 , and mine countermeasures programs . These all were incredibly costly . Many , like the mine countermeasures project , still had a long way to gothis was high-tech stuff that required lots of research and development . Editor : Any other comments on RMAs ? Smith : Just one . It seemed to me back in the 1990s and the first decade of this century that the Navy and Marine Corps were hung up on the notion that a new way of conducting amphibious operations must be found to strengthen their operational maneuver from the sea warfare concept , and they looked to RMAs in this area . The Army and the Air Force , on the other hand , thought that the question was not how to conduct amphibious operations better , but how to get into the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crusade to replace the Marine Corps " amphibious capability with the Army 's airborne ? Smith : I never once advocated a parochial campaign to advance the Army over the Marine Corps . The problem for the Marine Corps was that the airborne operation worked , just like split ARG operations worked in the decade before . In those austere days , once you made something work that offered economy , it became the way of doing business . I always have believed that the ArmyAir Force team can not go it alone . The eventual link with the Navy-Marine Corps at the port or beach is crucial to an operation 's staying power . Editor : You have been accused of parochialism because of your involvement in the planning during the Second Gulf War . There are accounts of you staunchly advocating the airborne over the Marines to get in country to Basra . Smith : I did fight strongly for the XVIIIth Corps to execute that mission , but only because it made sense . By that time , around 2010 , the Navy still had only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , this increased the marginal value of each ship ; the loss of even one was unacceptable . Mines still were a showstopper . Enemy mines got better and more plentiful , but our countermeasures efforts were little improved over premillennial capabilities thanks to budget constraints . The mission was similar to the one I conducted in Gabes , just on a larger scale , so I knew it could be done-especially with the new aircraft and heavy airdrop equipment we had just acquired . There were thousands of square miles of open desert to choose from for the airborne insertion , while the Marines would have to have gone across those beaches . The coast is a well-defined line , and the enemy had a fair idea of which beaches were the most likely avenues of approach . They had mined every square foot of oceanfront . Editor : The outcome ? Smith : Same as Gabes . It worked . Once we took Basra , we worked back to the gulf . Because we owned the land , the mine-clearing operation proceeded unhindered . Soon we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if you did n't seal the fate of amphibious operations , what did ? Smith : There were many factors . First was cost . To build an amphibious force that was impervious to attack during landing was an expensive undertaking because of the equipment and technology required . Second was the way the ARGs began to deploy and operate . By the end of the 1990s , the State Department had the ARGs " ships running around the oceans like the Keystone Cops used to run around police cars . The tasking continued to get more complex-and more frequent . Ship-to-objective maneuver ( STOM ) was key to these new challenges . The Marines needed STOM-it allowed them to skip beachfront obstacles rather than waste time , energy , and lives fighting through them . Third , there was the fact that Americans do not like casualties , and the amphibious environment could not promise bloodless landings . STOM helped here , too . The airborne assault was not risk free , but because the selection of drop zones for insertion allowed greater choices , and the drops at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greatly minimized . In the end , however , the single factor that terminated amphibious operations was the budget . Neither the Marine Corps nor the Army had any say in the matter . Editor : How so ? Smith : By the end of the last century , the military budget was spiraling downward . I forget the exact numbers , but by 1998 the defense budget was down 40% from its 1989 levels . Personnel were slashed as well , and there was no bottom in sight . Every year , Congress had another good reason why more could come out of the defense budget . That is what forced the split ARG deployment conundrum . Should we have been surprised ? By 1998 , only 46% of U.S. senators and 31% of our representatives had any military experience . These number continued to trend downward . Demographics worked against the military . Editor : That helps us understand why the budget went down , but again , how did that force the decision to cease amphibious operations ? Smith : It was hard to justify large defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go . Any hint of duplicity of effort was anathema . Amphibious operations were history . But the capability never was lost because no one could think of a better way to rescue Americans from overseas embassies in evacuation operations . Operational maneuver from the sea and ship-to-objective maneuver had great utility in these and other military operations other than war . Believe me , these are no small matters . Because the capability never was lost , amphibious assault always was a potential threat that enemies had to consider . That is why during the South China Sea crisis , when we had shiploads of Marines ready to retake Luzon World War II style , the enemy had to honor the threat of amphbous assault . STOM and evacuation operations capabilities allowed us to use amphibious assault as an effective ruse . This was an incredible headache for the enemy because they knew they were just as vulnerable to invasion anywhere inland from the sky . The enemy 's situation was untenable . Amphibious operations never again will be used in the main attack . The Marines now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision on how to conduct forcible entry . Through joint training , coordination , and dedication , the services made it viable and lethal to the enemy 's cause . Author Affiliation By Commander Robert G.
