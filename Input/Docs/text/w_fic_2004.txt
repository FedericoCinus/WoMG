" As the Girl Power guest editors we are pleased to have been able to select from those entries , Justin Scott 's story for inclusion in this issue . <p> Acknowledgment : The author wishes to thank Joann Houser of West Geauga High School for her guidance in the writing of this paper . <p> Xena hurled her mighty Chakram at her adversary to cleave the fiend in two ! But her aim was a little bit high and the beast dodged the projectile . The creature began to run , and Xena gave chase . " I must n't miss this time , " she thought to herself , " this time I must slice off his head . " Xena quickly caught up to the foul creature . The beast turned to face Xena -- a brave act to say the least . Xena saluted him and attacked , striking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not affecting the creature in the least ; it just stood there , not moving . Then suddenly : " Hey Xena ! Wake up ! " <p> Xena awoke to find herself standing atop Alicia 's desk in her third period study hall waving a banana in the air . She realized that she was not fending off the forces of evil , but merely challenging a fellow classmate . " I 'm very sorry , " Xena attempted to apologize . <p> " Yeah , whatever . Just do n't do it again , " replied her disgruntled classmate . <p> Xena went back to her seat , but on the way the bell rang , and she had to go to her next class . Xena had never really fit in at her school : she was what her other classmates had termed an " outcast . " She was different , somehow . She was n't quite sure how , she just knew that she was . <p> As she entered her fourth-period gym class , she saw all of the glaring stares telling her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that it was real this time . She had been sure that she was truly fighting that ugly black beast . Xena mindlessly went through gym class without even really thinking about their game of Lacrosse . She finished the rest of the day without event and got ready to go home . <p> The day was lovely . Xena walked slowly , admiring all of the new fall scenery . This was one of her favorite times of the year because of all the beautiful changing leaves . She came to the intersection that led to her street and paused . Normally , she would hurry home , but today she decided that she would go for a walk . " This is really beautiful , " she thought to herself . She was so busy admiring the trees that she did n't realize that she had wandered a little too far . " Where am I ? " she asked herself . Suddenly , a bright light shone around her and knocked her unconscious . <p> When Xena came to , she was lying down in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could not see the top of its massive peaks . Xena pulled herself to her feet and discovered that she was extremely weak . With this in mind , she settled on only sitting down instead of standing , " I wonder where I am . " <p> What seemed like several hours later , Xena was still sitting on the floor mulling over what to do . Suddenly , a bright light shone all about her , and an angelic voice spoke . " I see you are as strong as they say you are . " <p> " Who are you ? " Xena demanded . <p> " All in due time , my child . All in due time . " <p> " At least tell me where I am , " suggested Xena . <p> " You are in the sanctuary of souls , " replied the voice . <p> This puzzled Xena , and she did not speak anymore . " Why am I here ? Where exactly is here ? " These questions and many more flooded through her brain . Something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place it . The light suddenly grew and manifested itself into the form of a man . Presently Xena had the strength to move , and she stood up . " I 'm sorry about that , " apologized the being . <p> " Sorry for what ? " <p> " Never mind , it is of little consequence , " was the mysterious reply . " You may call me Rune . " <p> Rune ... that name seemed familiar as well . But again she could not place it . Why could n't she remember ? The memories seemed almost there . Infuriated , Xena fell silent . <p> " Now , to the business at hand , " started Rune . " You have been summoned here for a purpose . I , and several others , need your help . " <p> " .... " Xena was speechless . <p> " There is corruption in your place of education . This corruption is so vast that it endangers the very balance of the universe . We , the others and I , humbly request that you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's crazy ! What can I possibly do ? I may dream occasionally about fighting , but those are only dreams . I ca n't fight ! Trust me , you have the wrong person , " angrily replied Xena , admittedly more than a little scared . <p> " I can assure you that I have found the right person . Are you not Xena ? " <p> " Well , yes , I am . But I do n't see what that has to do with ... " <p> " It has everything to do with our situation . You merely do n't understand ... yet . Trust me , it will all return to you . All of it . " <p> There was obviously something that Rune was hiding from her , but Xena , again , just could n't figure it out . She decided that she would now play his little game . She would ask him questions : she would find out what was going on : " So , let 's assume that I do have the power to pull this off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for . Is it one of the teachers ? Is that where the corruption is ? " <p> " I 'm afraid I can not fully answer that . I can tell you that the evil did not start with the faculty . It began elsewhere , but some of the teachers have been swayed to the evil side . They are weak of heart , but are not entirely evil , so you must not harm them . What the evil truly is , I do n't even know . That is what you must find out . But now I 'm afraid our time has run out , and I must bid you adieu . " <p> Sudden bursts of light filled Xena 's eyes , almost like when she would stare at the sun too long and look away . Then she was gone . <p> " Beep ! Beep ! Beep ! " Xena 's alarm clock rang the next morning . Xena awoke to find herself lying in her bed , still in her clothes . " It must have been a dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> Xena ambled downstairs and got ready to go to school . She ate breakfast , showered , and changed into new clothes . Xena 's mother , as usual , gave disapproving looks to her goofy eating habits . Her eating was a constant topic of " discussion " between her and her mother . Xena 's mother often accused her of eating like a " medieval woman . " " Oh , well , let her think what she will , " thought Xena . <p> Xena tried to not think about Rune and the odd encounter during the course of the day , but she could n't help it . She did n't look at all of her teachers the same way ; she found herself wondering if this teacher , or that teacher , was her enemy . " Stop it , " she ordered herself . " The whole experience was n't even an experience , it never happened ! " But she could n't stop herself ; she just kept on wondering . <p> The beast came again . It was its normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales somewhat like a dragon . Also , it had large spikes covering almost its entire body . However , the worst aspect of the monster was its atrocious odor . But this time it acted different : the beast actually spoke . " I am the great beast Geo , and you 'll never defeat me ! It matters not if you receive your former powers , you will never be enough ! " <p> Xena woke with a start . This time she was not attacking a fellow student , rather she was just sitting in class . " What was that all about ? " she asked herself . That had never happened before , and this time the dream felt even more real . " Could this be related to what happened yesterday ? No , yesterday did n't happen ... it could n't have , " she frantically told herself . But she could n't even convince herself . This was real and it was happening , and she could n't think of what to do . <p> Xena went through the rest of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't concentrate on anything besides Rune and this beast Geo , and the fact that even if this is real she did n't know where to start . " This is all so confusing ! Why is this happening to me ? What do you want from me ? Why ... " she started to ask herself . " Oh , this is useless . " She realized that she could n't answer these questions without a little snooping . " I 'll come back tonight when it 's dark . I should be able to find answers then . " <p> That night , Xena was at home putting on a thin layer of black nylon over her clothing so that she could hide better . " I do n't really know what I 'm doing , but I have to do it , " she bravely said . She finished her preparations and crept downstairs . Her mother was asleep on the couch with Jay Leno playing on the TV . " Good-bye more , " Xena whispered . It was then time to go . Xena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run the whole way . She decided to sit down right in front of the huge fluorescent school sign so she could catch her breath . With that done , she went inside . <p> The school was dark as midnight , which the time actually approached . Xena gave her eyes time to adjust to the dark , and went forward . She was scared , yes , but she knew she had a job to do . She had never been this brave before and this courage surprised her . " Oh , well , I must go on with no distractions , " she commanded herself . <p> As she slunk along the empty hallways she thought of all the years that she had spent here . She thought of how she had changed and how she would go on changing . Suddenly , a noise disturbed her , distracting her thoughts . " What was that ? " she asked herself . " I do n't know , but I should probably hide . " She ducked inside of an old broom closet just in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a crack in the door and recognized the woman as her French teacher , Madame Canzone . She knew that she could probably knock her out before she knew what hit her . But then Rune 's warning of not harming the teachers came back to her , and she decided not to attack . <p> Xena decided that her first target should be the principal 's office . In movies , this was always where the important stuff was . So she headed down the hall towards it , passing all of her teacher 's classrooms , wondering if they were corrupted . She reached the office and hesitated . " What if I 'm not prepared ? What if I ca n't take what I meet on the other side of this door ? No , I ca n't think like that , if I could n't handle it then Rune would n't have sent me , " she resolved . And with that she opened the door . <p> What Xena saw on the other side of the door astonished her . It was only the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking about to attack unwary students . This was disappointing , but she decided to investigate the room anyway . Again , her own bravery surprised her . Before this whole ordeal she would n't have been able even to open the door , much less investigate a dark room . She swept through the room , rummaging . All she found were folders containing grades and some old suspension point forms . This was really no help to her at all , and she was about to lose hope when she noticed an indentation in the floor . " That 's funny , " she said to herself . She walked over to the indentation to investigate and discovered that it was really a trap door ! " Well , only one way to find out what 's down there , " Xena said to herself as she opened the door and descended . <p> The ladder that led down from the trap door seemed to go on forever . Xena could n't even begin to see the bottom when her arms became tired . " I 'm never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than stop , her body kept going until she finally hit the bottom . Sweat was streaming down her face as she set her foot down ; she wanted to collapse , but her body would n't let her . " Ugh , that was hard , but I must continue . I must persevere . " <p> Xena began the journey down through the tunnel that was ahead of her slowly at first , but then picked up speed . She knew that the evil that she sought must be just ahead ; it had to be ! Suddenly , she heard voices just ahead of her , and stopped . " I heard that a student is down here with us , " exclaimed the first voice . <p> " How can you know that ? " inquired the second . <p> " The leader told me , " explained the first . <p> " Oh , so that 's how it is . Well how does it know ? You ever think of that ? How can it know ? " <p> " It 's psychic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time Xena had recognized the voices of two of her favourite teachers . Not wanting to hurt them , she merely crept around them . " That was close , if I had n't stopped they would have caught me , " Xena thought . " Well I have to keep moving . " <p> She soon came to a wide-open area that seemed like it could house a giant . Unfortunately for Xena , she was exactly right ! There appeared to be a gigantic hulking mass in the opposite corner of the arena . She walked closer to see what this could be , and instantly recognized it . " This is the beast from my dreams ! " <p> " That is correct , little one , " came a " voice " in her head . <p> " What 's going on ? Who 's there ? How can you hear my thoughts ? " <p> " Oh , I thought you were the all-powerful Xena . I thought that my minions that I placed in your path would have allowed you to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual voice . <p> Suddenly , Xena understood . The teachers that she had escaped from before had let her go ! Then she realized that this was the creature that the teachers had called " the leader . " And also remembered that this creature was psychic . " So , you 're the one that I am supposed to defeat ? I see . We 've met before , so this should not be too difficult , " replied Xena cockily . <p> " I would n't celebrate so early if I were you ! In your dreams I was going easy on you . This time I will not . Hehehehe this should be fun ! " replied Geo , the great beast . <p> With that Geo ran at Xena . Xena , unsure what to do , ran as fast as she could in the other direction . A voice called out from above , " Xena ! " <p> With that a sword came hurtling through the air towards Xena , and she caught it with ease . " How did I possibly catch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , Geo , now a little less confident , charged at her . This time , rather than running , she sidestepped the advance , and cut Geo 's side as he went by . " What 's going on ? This feels so familiar . Have I fought before ? " Xena asked herself . <p> Squealing , Geo charged again . This time Xena met it head on and stuck her sword into the beast 's side . The great beast Geo then fell to the ground , never to get back up . Xena ran to its side and pulled her sword out of the beast 's flesh . And with a final squeal of defeat , Geo closed his eyes for the last time . The realization of what she had just done hit Xena like a brick , and she fell to her knees weeping with joy . Suddenly , she heard clapping . She turned to see Rune in his human form applauding her , " I could n't have done it better myself . " <p> " Why , thank you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Why , what do you mean ? " he jested . <p> " You know what I mean ! The sword , it was you , was n't it ? " <p> " Of course it was . Do you finally understand ? Do you know what it is that I 've been trying to teach you ? " <p> " I do n't think so . I only know that I was supposed to defeat this demon , " replied Xena . <p> " Here , maybe this will jog your memory , " as he tossed a circular object towards Xena . <p> It hit the ground at Xena 's feet . She hesitated for an instant , then knelt down to pick it up . She was at first confused , then the memories came searing back . She recalled this object from her dream , but had previously thought that she had merely imagined it . Then she remembered it all ! Remembered adventuring with her ally Gabrielle and fighting evil . Remembered that she was not just Xena . She was Xena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you , " said Rune . <p> " Yes , I 'm beginning to remember . But one thing puzzles me . How did I get here , in this young body ? Because I am me , only about five years younger , " asked Xena . <p> " I 'm afraid that I 'm guilty there . You see , back in your time in your body you were injured . But someone brought you to my sanctuary , and naturally , I healed you . But then I saw who you are , and I knew that these people needed a heroine like you . So I turned back your internal clock , and sent you here , " replied Rune . <p> " So that 's why the sanctuary and you seemed familiar earlier , and that 's why I was able to fight ! I understand now ! Why did n't you just tell me earlier ? " <p> " That would have been way too dangerous . If I had just changed you back you might have rejected it . However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you could n't reject it . Understand ? " <p> " I believe so , but I would like to go back to my own time now , can you send me ? " <p> " Yes , I can . But are you ready ? " <p> " Yes , I am . I suppose that I always have been . " <p> " Then I will open a portal of time and space now . Stand back , " said Rune . <p> There was the sound of cloth being torn , and next thing that Xena knew there was a doorway in front of her . Through this doorway she saw her time and her old body sleeping . " Do I really want to go back ? " she asked herself . " Yes , I must . Good-bye , Rune . I will not forget you ! " <p> " Nor , I you . Farewell and godspeed ! " <p> And thus Xena , Warrior Princess , saved a small town school and the rest of the universe . She never forgot Rune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with a broad smile on her face Xena entered the portal , and returned to her own time and body . <p> Article copyright Batya Weinbaum . <p> 
##1010866 " LOVE YOU , " she said . Cameras looked into her face and I looked into her eyes . For a moment I could really believe it . Anne never was that good at lying . A woman behind us started to cry , in the restrained way that some people do in public . <p> Now it was my turn . <p> We had n't rehearsed this . It was n't the kind ofthing one could rehearse . " I 've always loved you , " I said . It was the closest I 've come in my life to an apology . <p> Maybe that was why Anne looked so shocked . <p> The idea of matter so dense that even light can not escape from its surface goes back to the i8th century and the obscure English geologist John Michell . For seven years , Anne and I had survived a marriage like that . <p> Apparently children take on the attributes of their parents . Anne 's parents were natural observers , seeing everything from a single point . Mine were different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . My father was the polar opposite . As if he 'd collapsed in on himself to create a black hole around which his five children continued to circle in a cold dark orbit . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Anne said . <p> It must have been obvious to the organisers that the situation was disintegrating around them , because someone pushed Lisa and Sammy forward , fresh-faced , slightly dishevelled and embarrassed in that pre-teen way . <p> " Bye , Dad , " they chorused , about as convincing as Joseph and Mary in a nativity play . <p> I kissed them both and ruffled their hair , a second before remembering they hated that . It said something for their best behaviour that neither even pulled a face . <p> " I 'll call , " I promised . <p> Wide eyes looked puzzled . <p> " That was a joke , " I wanted to say . Luckily Lisa got it in time to prevent me looking an even bigger fool than I felt . My father stepped forward , threw his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't as if we often saw eye to eye , then he surprised me . <p> " Good luck ... " He thought about what he 'd just said , in that dry mathematical way of his , and shrugged . " Not that luck comes into it , of course ... " <p> The launch passed in a blur after that . Everyone passes beyond the point of no return . We go from one lover to another , switch jobs or abandon friends when circumstance or necessity demands . Christmas is always bad . The year might change but the feelings do n't . <p> It began with an argument . <p> At least I think it did . <p> The fault was mine . <p> I kissed a girl at an office party , or she might have kissed me . The Norwegian Wood Defence beats Stockholm Syndrome any day . If in doubt , claim someone changed the parameters . <p> ( That was an obscure joke about music no one now remembers . Although I do : I remember everything . The only problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the time I find the piece to fit , the jigsaw has changed and I can no longer remember the picture . ) <p> I kissed a girl , someone told my wife and I returned from a pre-Christmas shop to find my marriage being counted out on a carpet in the middle of the living room . The fight was over before I even knew it had begun . Oh , she took me back , media attention saw to that . Media attention , an increased pension and the fact I was about to leave her life altogether . <p> The Earth 's escape velocity is more than n kilometres per second ( roughly 40,000 kilometres per hour ) , that of the sun more than 600 kilometres per second . Where I was going had no escape velocity . At least , none within the bounds of physics as we understand it . A dozen people had died . The official total had been three , until the Chinese admitted they lost nine in the first year of trying . Beijing offered this information the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Personally , I think they were just trying to put us off . <p> I ate the turkey , pulled crackers , drank enough brandy to make my head hurt . The sex was clumsy and Anne cried , telling me she did n't know how we came to this . So I lied and said these things happen and it did n't matter , but of course it did . We woke with hangovers , still wrapped in each other 's arms . <p> In one of those ironies of life . the sex improved and 1 found myself not minding the children 's questions , their endless mess . We ate meals together , I came back early from the laboratory . All right , I 'll admit it , the cameras following me probably helped . At night , alone together , Anne and I repaired what we had . It was like painting the rooms in a house you intend to abandon . Pointless , but the instinct was strong . <p> Our brief separation became a plus point . So difficult had been the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Anne 's bravery was mentioned ; my selflessness . Pundits in the middlebrow rags worried about the effect my decision would have on Lisa and Sammy . Since they barely saw me I assumed this would be rather less than most people imagined , although the two of them grew quite clingy once they realised I was going on a long journey . <p> If I 've got this right , a black hole holds in place a spherical surface that marks its boundary . Depending on how one looks at this , the event horizon is either entirely static , locked in place around a singularity , or hurtling outwards at the speed of light . Whichever , consider the Schwarzschild radius an irrevocable decision . Once reached , you really ca n't back out . <p> The launch was simple . I was put into a capsule and the capsule was put somewhere else . There were no flames , nada smoke , zero mirrors . Someone in Public Relations decided we needed a countdown . The same person probably came up with the silver aircraft hangar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't call it that , of course . In fact , we spent a lot of time telling other people they should n't call it that , but the name stuck . <p> I 've always preferred the older term , " frozen star " , for that state of seeming to exist while not actually existing , which describes the sphere around a singularity . Only once " black hole " got used instead , the original term never stood a chance . So it was with our gate . <p> We counted down from 120 , this being the number chosen by a focus group as representing the exact mix of excitement and suspense required . Anything less would not stretch the nerves of the world ; anything more and we risked boring them . One hundred and twenty seconds . The transference of a single human halfway across a galaxy and we had suits worrying that we might bore our audience . <p> Budget rounds can do strange things to people . <p> In fact , what happened inside the hangar was infinitely more complex than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , who considered that paying taxes gave them a moral veto over what we did with our share of the money , we fudged things a little around the edges . Partly this kept the suits happy and partly it meant Anne and the children never really had to face what was about to happen . <p> I stepped into a shell , the door was shut and the shell swung towards the gate as countdown hit zero . It is not my job to decide if what happened next was dishonest , but radiation blue-shifts to very high frequencies . Not wanting me to get fried , the director had the shell reappear instantly in a hangar behind the one we used . Three weeks later , when the media had moved onto something else , what was left of me was reloaded into the shell and shifted to the real exit gate , a transient white hole near the centre of the galaxy . To complete the Schwarzschild geometry set one needs a black hole , a white hole and two universes linked at their horizons by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficiently large , the tidal forces are not really noticeable until after you cross the horizon . A smaller black hole , say one made from our sun , should such a thing be possible , would rip you apart long before you reached this . Hence the choice of my destination . A million solar masses gives a radius of roughly 3 million kilometres , about four times the radius of the sun and large enough to let me surf j ust above the horizon . ( Even with a hole exceeding 30,000 solar masses the tide at the horizon would be less than ig . ) <p> You will already know the mathematics behind the incredible expenditure of energy needed to keep me in position . At least I assume you do . If not , I should probably be talking to somebody else . <p> Everyone passes beyond the point of no return . We go from one job to another , change lovers or abandon families when selfishness or need demands . Leaving home is always bad . Thebundleofclothesinthe cardboard box , the half bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne does n't drink it anyway . The refusal to look back as the taxi draws away . Even after I returned home , what we had felt illicit . Something temporary that the coming year would fracture . <p> As it did . <p> I signed the original forms in anger sometime in late December , only to spend most of January explaining to Human Resources that " Yes I meant it ... IfI had n't meant it then I would n't have suggested it , would I ? " Looking back , I 'm pretty certain they knew the person I needed to convince was myself . <p> I signed waiver forms in early February , had two medicals and underwent psychiatric testing . Though how one can test the sanity of any man who volunteers to watch the ageing of the universe in fast forward , before dying himself , is beyond me . As I said , so much is absurdity . <p> By Valentine 's Day the launch was ready , and 10 days later I was passing 1.5 Schwarzschild radii , the last point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in free-fall orbit is drawn towards the singularity . Obviously enough , I kept the engine constantly on burn . <p> So now I dream and watch , sleep , wake and wonder what the difference is between these states . I work at slow speeds over long lengths of time , and always the sky above me changes while the horizon remains . Pairs consisting of an antiparticle and particle appear from nowhere , exist briefly , and cancel each other out . There is a suggestion that the mass behind the horizon evaporates . It seems to be happening because one of these two particles sometime fall beyond retrieval , letting the other escape . <p> Since we define a black hole as a region of space-time not in the causal past of any point in the infinite future , this gives an obvious problem . Not least because the universe appears to have no infinite future , recollapsing to a singularity in finite coordinate time . Next to this , my own slow wait for the black hole to evaporate and free me from this impossible orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch , I had supper with my father in London at a hotel off the Strand . We talked about the weather , the government , the under-funding of universities , things on which we knew we could agree . Outside the Savoy we shook hands , then embarrassed each other with a brief hug . An argument mended without ever having been mentioned . <p> I went home , called my mother-inlaw and asked if she could have the children for the night because I needed to talk to Anne . She came immediately , bundled the delighted children into her Volvo and drove away . Anne and I went to bed for two days . We talked of things neither of us could remember until we began to talk about them . Stupid things , little things . <p> She cried , asked if I could change my mind . I cried , said probably not . <p> At the end of the two days her mother brought Lisa and Sammy back and all three frowned at the unwashed plates in the sink , the empty wine bottles beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both still wearing dressing gowns . We tidied up , watched television , put the children to bed , tried not to mind the cameras that followed our every move . <p> " The kids will miss you , " she said . <p> For a moment I saw the sadness in her eyes . " I 'll miss them , " I promised . <p> Anne and I held hands as we walked out to face the press on that final day . I think even we were surprised by that . <p> Sidebar 
##1010867 Nat Turner and his fellow rebels plot their revolt . <p> Nat Turner and his fellow rebels plot their revolt . <p> INTRODUCTION As the 19th century began , the country was beginning to be pulled apart by the issue of slavery . In the North , abolitionists attacked slavery as evil . But many Southerners claimed that slaves were vital to their farm-based economy . Besides , these Southerners said , slaves were happy where they were . In 1831 , a troubled slave named Nat Turner helped to explode that myth . SCENE 1 Narrator A : Almost everything we know about Nat Turner comes from a confession he made to a white lawyer named Thomas R. Gray . The date was November 1 , 1831 ; the place , Turner 's jail cell . Ten days later , he would be executed . Nat Turner ( in his confession ) : Sir , to tell you why I am here , I need to go back to my infancy . Certain unforgettable circumstances laid the ground-work for the tragic events for which I am about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On October 2 , 1800 , Nat Turner was born a slave on the Southampton County , Virginia , farm of Benjamin Turner . Nat 's mother , Nancy , held on to her native African beliefs . Nancy : Old Bridget , I tell you the boy has spirit vision . Just yesterday , he was speaking to the other children of things that happened " before he was born ! Old Bridget : He is a special one . The markings on his head and body show he is designed for some great purpose . Narrator A : Unusual for the time , Nat 's master allows him to attend church with the whites . In the process of studying the Bible , Nat learns to read . Old Bridget : He 's been doing it from a young age , Master Ben . We gave him a book to keep him from crying-and he began sounding out the words ! Benjamin Turner : With such a restless mind , this boy will never be of use to anyone as a slave . Narrator A : Others around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C E N E 2 Narrator B : Nat embraces Christian beliefs with fervor . By the time he is a young man , he is astounding many of those around him with his preaching . Nat Turner : And as I stood praying at my plow , the Holy Spirit spoke to me , saying , " seek ye the Kingdom of Heaven and all things shall be added given to you . " Female slave : God be praised . The Spirit speaks to him like the prophets in the old days . Narrator B : But nothing shields Nat from the cruelties of bondage . When he is 21 , he runs away from an overseer and hides in the woods . While there , he has a disturbing vision . Spirit : Nat , what have you done ? Nat Turner : Oh , Spirit , I am bowed down by this heavy weight . What is the purpose I am born for ? How can I fulfill my destiny as a slave ?

Narrator B : When Turner returns to the farm after 30 days , the other slaves are amazed-or suspicious . Male slave I : Why do you think he came back ? Do you think he really has those visions of his ? Male slave 2 : Tell you one thing-if I had his gifts , no way would I serve any master . Nat Turner ( in his confession ) : With the revelations made known to me , I began to direct my attention to the purpose for which I was intended . And I had a vision of spirits in battle and thunder in the heavens , and the sun was darkened . And a voice said , " This is what you are called to bear . " S C E N E 3 Narrator C : As the years pass , Turner suffers the injustices of slavery . In 1822 , his wife is sold away from him .

Nat Turner : One day we will crush the evil serpent . And the first shall be last , and the last shall be first . REBELS and ABOLITIONISTS TIME LINE <p> Narrator C : In February 1831 , there is an eclipse of the sun .

One by one , they kill all the white people they find , many still in their beds . SCENE 4 Narrator D : As the men make their fateful journey , their number grows to about 50 . The death toll also mounts , to 55 . Around midday , Turner and his men head to Jerusalem , the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency army of citizens . Hark Travis : We ca n't face them head-on with their rifles . Our people are getting hit , and others are scattering . Nat Turner : Let 's circle around the militia and go on to town .

Now , militia are everywhere , and with each confrontation , more men desert Turner . Finally , he is alone .

SCENE 5 Narrator E : While Turner hides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia man : They say that an army of 500 slaves is marching out of the swamps right now , ready to butcher us all . Reporter ( in his newspaper article ) : It is believed that all the brigands bandits were slaves-and most , if not all of them , the property of kind and indulgent masters . Narrator E : On October 30 , a white man named Benjamin Phipps finds Turner still hiding near the Travis farm . Phipps takes the runaway slave into custody at gunpoint . Turner is soon hauled before a judge . Judge Jeremiah Cobb : Let the prisoner rise . Do you have anything to say for yourself ? Nat Turner : I plead not guilty because I do not feel guilty . I only did what I was destined to do . Cobb : Your hands are stained with the blood of the innocent , and the blood of a master . The judgment of this court is that you will be hung by the neck until you are dead , dead , dead !

In all , Virginia executes at least 55 people in connection with the rebellion . But Turner 's legend will only grow , and for years slaves and ex-slaves will speak in hushed tones of Old Nat 's war . " AFTERWORD Although Turner 's rebellion failed , its effects were later felt . Alarmed that other uprisings could follow , the South passed a number of harsh laws further restricting the movement of slaves . White mobs sought revenge by killing as many as 200 black people .

This play is filled with misery and woe , involving three clever youngsters , a terrible fire , a refrigerator , and man-eating leeches . We 're sorry to tell you that it 's based on the new movie Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events , which is based on the books The Bad Beginning , The Reptile Room , and The Wide Window , by Mr. Snicket .

SCENE THE FIRST SNICKET 1 : The play you are about to read is very unpleasant . It has no happy ending , no happy beginning , and very few happy things in the middle . SNSCKET 2 : That is because not many happy tilings occurred in the lives of the three Baudelaire children . Violet , the oldest , was one of the finest 14-year-old inventors the world has ever known . Photograph Klaus , Violet , and Baby Sunny get ready to hear some bad news . <p> VIOLET : When I tie my hair up with a ribbon , it means I 'm thinking of a new invention .

SUNNY : Gack ! SUNNY 'S TRANSLATOR : ... which meant , " Look at that mysterious figure emerging from the fog . " KLAUS : Mr. Poe ? From the bank ? MR . POE : I 'm afraid I must inform you of ... an extremely unfortunate event . Your parents have perished in a fire that destroyed your home . SNICKET 2 : And just like that , the Baudelaire children became the Baudelaire orphans . MR . POE : " Perished " means " died . " KLAUS : We know what " perished " means . MR . POE : The bank will manage your inheritance until you come of age . In the meantime , you will be sent to live with your closest relative , Count Olaf , just 37 blocks away . KLAUS : I do n't think that 's what " closest " is supposed to mean . VIOLET : We do n't know any " Count Olaf .

I must say , you are a gloomy bunch . Why so bummed ? KLAUS : Our parents just died . COUNT OLAF : Oh yes . How VERY awful . Well , as long as you 're staying with me , you 'll do whatever I ask while I enjoy the enormous fortune your parents left behind . You will all sleep in one bed . VIOLET ( to Klaus ) : Maybe it 's not as bad as it seems . SNICKET 1 : It was as bad as it seemed . Count Olaf was vile and cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous chores , including ladderless ceiling repair , toxic waste disposal , and dishwashing , until ...

KLAUS : Violet , where did the locks go ? SNICKET 3 : If you have ever been locked inside a car parked on train tracks , you know it is not a very pleasant place to be . SUMNY : Uhoh ! SUNNY 'S TRANSLATOR : Especially when a train is approaching ! VIOLET : Klaus , please tell me you 've read something about trains . KLAUS : We need to switch the tracks . Look-there 's the switcher ! VIOLET : I 'd better tie my hair up . SNICKET 4 : In seconds , Violet had invented a device that shot out the car window and hit the track switcher ... SUNNY : Eyebulls !

POE : Count Olaf , I just found Sunny in the driver 's seat of your car . Allowing an infant to drive is not good parenting . I 'm sending the Baudelaires to live with a more suitable guardian . COUNT OLAF ( to the children ) : No matter where you go , I 'll find you . I 'm going to get my hands on your fortune if it 's the last thing I do !

" This snake is actually one of the friendliest creatures in the animal kingdom . SUNNY : Slickit ! SUNNY 'S TRANSLATOR : ... which meant , " It does n't even hurt when she bites me ! " UNCLE MONTY : You 're safe now , children . We have so much in common . I know what it 's like to lose those you love in a terrible fire . We 'll have a wonderful time together . SCENE THE FOURTH SNICKET 1 : It seemed like everything might be better for the Baudelaires . Uncle Monty was a very kind guardian . But then the bell tolled ... SNICKET 2 : ... an expression which here means " the doorbell rang , and it was a person whom the children recognized right away , even though he was in disguise . " STEPHANO : My name is Stephano . I am here to assist Dr. Montgomery in his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know of any such incredibly handsome person . UNCLE MONTY : Children , who is it ? My new assistant , Stephano ! Thank goodness you 've arrived ! VIOLET : Uncle Monty , psssttt ! SNICKET 3 : The children tried to tell Uncle Monty that Stephano was an impostor . UNCLE MONTY ( whispering ) : I know , he 's a spy here to steal my discovery . We 'll talk tomorrow . SNICKET 4 : But sometimes even the most learned grown-ups are not very smart . By the next morning , it was too late . STEPHANO : Children , how terrible . Your uncle was killed by the Incredibly Deadly Viper , one of the deadliest snakes in the world . I should know . I discovered it . KLAUS : That 's a lie ! The Incredibly Deadly Viper is n't dangerous at all . You must have killed Uncle Monty ! SNICKET 1 : Mr. Poe arrived at Uncle Monty 's . STEPHANO : These children are in shock . But I 'd still be happy to be their guardian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Nonsense . He does n't look anything like Count Olaf . Mr. Stephano has a mustache . SNICKET 2 : Suddenly , there was a scream so horrible it still gives me nightmares to imagine it . SUNNY : AAAHHHHH ! ! ! ! TRANSLATOR : AAAAHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! MR . POE : The Incredibly Deadly Viper is attacking Sunny ! SNICKET 3 : But then Sunny began to giggle . She and the snake rolled on the floor playfully . MR . POE : That snake is harmless . STEPHANO : Egad . It appears my plot has been foiled ... by the baby ! SNICKET 4 : Unfortunately , by the time Mr. Poe turned around , Stephano had already escaped . SCENE THE FIFTH SNICKET 1 : The children 's next guardian , Aunt Josephine , lived in a house held up by rickety stilts on the side of a cliff overlooking Lake Lachrymose ... SNICKET 2 : ... a complicated description which here means " not a very good idea , because it would soon be hit by a hurricane . " AUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But do n't use the doorknobs , they might explode ! And do n't go near the refrigerator , it could fall and crush you ! SNICKET 3 : I 'm sorry to tell you that Aunt Josephine was terrified of nearly everything-except grammar . AUNT JOSEPHINE : Grammar is the greatest joy in life , do n't you find ? I 've been so lonely since my husband , Ike , was killed ... KLAUS : Was it a fire ? AUNT JOSEPHINE : Oh , no . He was eaten by the Lachrymose Leeches while swimming . SNICKET 4 : The next day the children were shopping with Aunt Josephine when Violet confronted her own worst fear ... VIOLET : Umph ! SNICKET 1 : ... an expression which here means , " Count Olaf dressed as a peg-legged fisherman . " CAPTAIN SHAM ( to Josephine ) : Forgive me for bumping into your sister . AUNT JOSEPHINE : Sister ?

Captain Sham and I will meet you at home . SCENE THE SIXTH SNICKET 3 : When they got back , the children found nothing but a broken window , a sinking feeling , and a very upsetting note . KLAUS : It says she 's jumped out the window , and she willed us to Captain Sham ! But it 's filled with grammatical errors . VIOLET : Aunt Josephine would never make mistakes like that . KLAUS : Wait-it 's a code . She 's hiding in Curdled Cave ! SNICKET 4 : This is the part of the play where a hurricane hits Aunt Josephine 's house , and you should probably stop reading . SNICKET 1 : Unless you want to know about the beam that snapped ... VIOLET : Run for it ! SNICKET 2 : ... the refrigerator that fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ... or the doorknobs that exploded . VIOLET : No way ! SNICKET 4 : Helped by another clever invention of Violet 's , the children barely escaped before the house fell off the cliff . SUNNY : Phew ! SONNY 'S TRANSLATOR : ... which meant , " That was close ! Now let 's find Aunt Josephine . " KLAUS : I 've read a few books on sailing . SCENE THE SEVENTH SNICKET 1 : As you probably know , children should never sail alone through hurricanes . But these were special circumstances . AUNT JOSEPHINE : Children , you found me ! I knew you 'd figure out my code . Olaf forced me to write that note ! SNICKET 2 : Sailing back to town with Aunt Josephine seemed like a good idea ... SNlCKET 3 : ... until the flesh-eating Lachrymose Leeches attacked . AUNT JOSEPHINE : We 're doomed ! VIOLET : Wait-there 's a boat in the distance .

SNICKET 2 : Very well . Suddenly , another boat appeared . MR . POE : Children , is that you ? COUNT OLAF : I saved them from the leeches ! MR . POE : I was wrong about you , Olaf . You 've proven yourself . If it was n't for you ... COUNT OLAF : Do n't say it ! Even their enormous inheritance would be a constant reminder of my heartache . MR . POE : Oh , you would n't get the fortune if anything happened to the children . That only applies to blood relatives and married couples . COUNT OLAF ( quietly ) : I think I have an idea for a play ... SCENE THE EIGHT SNICKET 3 : The Marvelous Marriage starred Count Olaf and Violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Olaf will get our fortune if he marries you . VIOLET : But Klaus , this is just a play in Olaf 's backyard ! COUNT OLAF : Except that Justice Strauss from the City High Court is playing the justice of the peace . KLAUS : But Violet 's only 14 . She ca n't get married ! COUNT OLAF : She can if she has the permission of her guardian . And who 's that ? Me ! VIOLET : I 'll never say " I do ! " COUNT OLAF : Really ? ( into a walkie talkie ) Drop her . SNICKET 4 : Count Olaf had hatched his most dastardly scheme yet ...

As you read , notice the vivid adjectives and sensory details author Suzanne Collins uses to make this odd world spring to life .

It was her way to intimidate him , but he would n't be intimidated . Gregor looked straight into the girl 's eyes and saw that her irises were a dazzling shade of light purple . He held his ground . Gregor did n't know how long they might have stood there sizing each other up if Boots had n't intervened . She plowed into the girl , knocking her off balance . The girl staggered back a step and looked at Boots in disbelief . Boots grinned winningly and held up a pudgy hand . " Ball ? " she said hopefully . The young queen of the Underland has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee and held out the ball to Boots , but she kept her fingers wrapped tightly around it . " It is yours if you can take it , " she said in a voice like her eyes : cold , clear , and foreign . Boots tried to take the ball , but the girl did n't release it . Confused , she pulled on the girl 's fingers . " Ball ? " The girl shook her head . " You will have to be stronger or smarter than I am . " Boots looked up at the girl , registered something , and poked her right in the eye . " Pu-ple ! " she said . The girl jerked back , dropping the ball . Boots scrambled after it and scooped it up .

The girl decided to take it as an apology . " I will forgive it as you are not knowing . What are you called , Overlander ? " " My name is Gregor . And that 's Boots , " he said , pointing to his sister . " What 's your name ? " " I am Queen Luxa , " said the girl . " Louk-za ? " said Gregor , trying to get the odd inflection right .
