The Dolphins had nearly completed a focused week of preparation for a Monday night of madness in Joe Robbie Stadium against the dangerous Los Angeles Raiders . Now it was time for music , laughter and reflection . <p> Cross was attempting to explain the seemingly inexplicable , how the once-ridiculed Dolphin defense had turned ashes into beauty this season . He knew where to begin the story . <p> He is a 6-foot-4-inch , 272-pound defensive end from Missouri who lasted until the ninth round in the 1988 draft . He made one start as a rookie and started all 16 games last season , earning 10 sacks . Through nine games this season , Cross already has 10 sacks and the Dolphins have skyrocketed to the National Football League 's No. 1 total defense ranking , No. 1 pass defense ranking , No. 2 run defense mark and a glittering 8-1 record . In the previous four seasons , Miami had slipped to 8-8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playoffs . <p> His coaches and teammates will tell you that Cross is a consummate athlete , a trembling combination of brute force and sheer quickness . But the 24-year-old player offered a different sort of analysis . He gazed upward toward the bright , sun-filled sky and concentrated on every word as he explained his and the Dolphins ' rise . <p> " We have a lot of young guys on this team , " Cross began . " Everyone looks at us now and asks , ' What 's happening down there ? ' The simplest answer is that everyone in this league ca n't be an overnight success like the Barry Sanderses and the Derrick Thomases . Some need the time to progress and improve , like myself . There is so much to this game other than just lining up and playing . <p> " Now I 'm putting myself into better position to make plays . We all are . We 've got a lot of guys on this defense that are hungry and searching for an identity in this league . <p> " This game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're playing in front of the nation and the whole league . In essence , this Monday night game is like a playoff for us . This is where we seek our staple of approval . " <p> Here is why school is still out on the Dolphins : they have beaten the lowly New England Patriots twice , the Jets twice and struggling Phoenix and Indianapolis once . They were whipped , 20-3 , by the undefeated Giants . After their game against the 6-3 Raiders comes a testy five-game stretch at Cleveland , at Washington , at home against Philadelphia and Seattle , then at Buffalo on Dec. 23 . <p> The Dolphins have no doubts that they can maintain their level of play as the season continues . " We do n't need to do anything differently , " Cross said . " We 're for real . " <p> What the Dolphins have accomplished after laboring near the bottom of the N.F.L. in defensive ranking and performance throughout the later part of the 1980 's is amazing . Look no further than Oct. 29 last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro across the line of scrimmage in an embarrassing 31-17 loss in which the Dolphins gave up 280 rushing yards . <p> Don Shula , the Dolphins ' venerable head coach , has worked magic for 28 N.F.L. seasons , 21 of those in Miami . No one knows the ups and downs in pro football more than Shula , and that disaster in Buffalo may have provided his career with its low point . <p> " We were 4-3 and I felt we were on the way to turning things around on the defense , " Shula said , wincing as he recalled how he stood in the dark tunnels at Rich Stadium that afternoon and shivered and shook , completely spent . " Going up there and getting hammered like that with them just running over us and holding onto the ball for something like 43 minutes and then us winding up losing four of our last five games as everything fell apart -- that was it . I knew we had to become more physical . " <p> Last February , Shula hired his longtime friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , as the Dolphins ' director of player personnel . Clark signed eight Plan B free agents including two who became starters : Tony Paige , a fullback from Detroit , and Cliff Odom , a linebacker from Indianapolis . And Miami traded for Tim McKyer , a 49er cornerback . <p> Just as important , the team drafted two huge offensive linemen , Richmond Webb and Keith Sims , and made them starters on the left side . Another draft pick , Alfred Oglesby , has become a rookie starter at nose tackle . J. B. Brown , a 12th-round pick from Maryland in 1989 , became a starter at cornerback . A rookie free agent from last year , David Griggs , who spent most of last season on the developmental squad as a tight end and linebacker , was moved permanently to linebacker . <p> " It was all I heard when I got here , that we have to have more muscle in our linemen and linebackers , " Clark said . " We had to have some strength and power and size to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . Take Griggs . The coaches did n't even know this guy in training camp . Now , Griggs is about 6-3 and up to about 250 and hitting and playing . " <p> The Dolphins ' secondary features Louis Oliver and Jarvis Williams at safety and McKyer and Brown at cornerback . <p> McKyer is a critical addition . He helped to win two Super Bowls with the 49ers , but last season , he felt unappreciated and misused . McKyer 's constant chatter , his commitment to on-field excellence , his savvy man-to-man coverage skills and his talk about another Super Bowl ring were infectious among the Dolphins . <p> " I saw right away they had talent here but not a mental approach toward winning , " McKyer said . " I tried to challenge everyone right away . I talked about the Super Bowl . And then I backed it up with performance . " <p> Everyone , Oliver said , took notice . " I think we were lacking in confidence and Tim gave the whole team some of that , on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building each practice , each game . We already had some quiet leaders , but Tim was a new breeze around here . " <p> Brown , who did not start a game in his rookie season in ' 89 , watched and listened and learned from McKyer . After injuries to other cornerbacks opened the door for him in training camp , Brown bolted through and has nearly become a McKyer clone . This duo 's ability to play single coverage has freed the entire defense to take more chances , to become more versatile . McKyer has three interceptions and has successfully defended 11 passes ; Brown has a sack , 22 tackles and has defended nine passes . <p> " I really believe that besides quarterback , the cornerback position has the most pressure , " Brown said . " A receiver can sense when you are scared out there and they come after you . I knew early with Tim over there , they were going to come after me . I 'm still building my reputation , but none of the teams we 've played have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has allowed a league-low 10.7 points a game . It has not allowed an offensive touchdown in 12 consecutive quarters nor a rushing touchdown in a team-record 24 consecutive quarters . The players said their 1990 3-4 defensive alignment is much simpler and more aggressive and is another reason why the Dolphins have become sharks , relentlessly pursuing the football . <p> This is gratifying for Tom Olivadotti , the defensive coordinator , who , in his fourth season in Miami , no longer is quizzed on when his defenses will finally turn the tide . But the memory of where the Dolphins languished under Olivadotti , finishing 26th , 26th and 24th in total defense in 1987-89 , remains fresh . <p> " We 've got seven games left and a long way to go , " Olivadotti said , " but does what we have achieved have an effect on me ? Sure it does . How could you not take the criticism we 've had personally ? But I do n't think people realized how close we were to turning it around last year . " <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense has taken a backseat to the defense ; the running game has matched the passing game , and the quarterback , Dan Marino , has easily accepted his new role . Miami believes that the offense has yet to bust loose this season , and that Marino can still dominate with deep passes . <p> " We have simply improved in all areas , " Shula said . " When we had the undefeated season and won the Super Bowl in ' 72 , 4-0 became 8-0 and 12-0 and 13-0 all the way to 16-0 . It just grew into a monster . " <p> Is that what 's happening now ? Another monster mash by the Dolphins , led by their defense , this time all they way to Super Bowl XXV in Tampa ? 
##3000051 <p> FROM a distance , he looks untouched and unchanged from the images burned into worldwide consciousness two years ago . The muscled arms , thighs and calves , a stunning blur of power and grace : none of it has betrayed him . Now as then , Ben Johnson fairly screams down the track , as if never quite touching it , as if once again the world 's fastest human . <p> Without a calendar , one might easily imagine this were an afternoon workout of years ago , not one last week , so soon after his two years in athletic purgatory for drug use . Once , twice , three times and again he reached speeds that would jeopardize world indoor records . The Metropolitan Toronto Track and Field Centre is a municipal facility , so scores of other athletes were training at the same time . Except when Johnson took off again . Then , many of them stopped to watch . <p> Maybe his form , his stride , and projected times of recent workouts are not so surprising at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , Ontario . " The past two years , it 's like they put a tiger in a cage and did n't feed him , but they left food just outside the cage , and he wants to tear it down and get to the food , " said Johnson 's older brother , Eddie . " Ben 's the tiger . He 's hungry to get out . " <p> If his muscles remain formidable and his times imposing , Johnson has nonetheless undergone dramatic changes since a positive drug test at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , pushed him off a world stage into the darkness of embarrassment and humiliation . The hunger his brother revealed is part of it . There 's much more , which would frame one overriding question for each 100-meter race he runs in the year ahead and the Olympic season that follows : Can Ben Johnson , whose drug use once fueled his speed , fame and fortune , replicate the past without drugs and the coach who spent 11 years turning a 15-year-old , 93-pound weakling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed in September , he appears relieved of a heavy pall held in place by the pain he caused his family and himself and the disgrace he brought upon Canada . His face no longer gloomy and drawn nor his eyes yellowed by years of steroid use , a common side effect , he now projects brightness and light . Once dour , isolated and suspicious of strangers , he 's now quick with a smile and a joke . <p> " Do n't listen to him , " he yapped at a reporter seeking insight from Eddie , a 32-year-old evangelist four years older than Ben . " He 's lying . " Ben cackled in delight . <p> So , too , has his body changed . Though it remains chiseled in all respects , his torso shows far less of the bulkiness so evident during the last of the drug years , particularly about the shoulders . A sleekness has replaced the cuts . His neck is thinner . He looks more like a sprinter who enjoys body building than a body builder who might try a sprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime endured since the Seoul Olympics : a world record in the 100 meters , the positive drug test , the loss of his gold medal , the loss of his world records , public scorn , but then rehabilitation through training , speaking to school-aged children -- " Maybe 60 appearances in two years , " he guessed -- a new coach , even a hint of redemption within Canada as many others have been found to be using drugs , including American and Soviet athletes . So maybe Ben was n't the only one , after all , just one unfortunate enough to get caught . Even his picture is back up on the training center 's wall of fame . <p> " It 's been a tough time , " he said , now in the weight room for bench presses and squats . " But even though I 've been hurting , I 've kept in the best shape . Staying in shape , that part has been easy . I knew I 'd be back on the track sometime . " <p> Johnson 's winter season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoor championships , starting March 8 in Seville , Spain . He knows the craziness that awaits , the intense scrutiny he expects from curious track fans to the less sophisticated who enjoy any manner of freak shows . It is unclear which category includes meet directors ; they have guaranteed him anywhere from $30,000 ( Los Angeles ) to $100,000 ( Osaka ) . <p> The outdoor season follows , May through August with the world championships in Tokyo , a meet held only once every four years , and things can only get crazier . For all the world records he lost , none meant more than those he set over 100 meters , the most compelling outdoor event in track and field . His winning time in Seoul , 9.79 seconds , was washed away by his urine sample . Six months later , when he admitted under oath he had used performance-enhancing drugs since 1981 , he was stripped of his previous mark , the 9.83 he ran in Rome at the last world championships . <p> Worse yet , his fiercest rival , Carl Lewis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seoul in 9.92 seconds . <p> Are the records reachable ? It is the sad state of track and field that makes the answer nearly impossible to guess . While Johnson has been tested at least five times during his suspension , other athletes have demonstrated that drug use continues . Just two weeks ago , two prominent Americans , Butch Reynolds and Randy Barnes , each a world record holder and Olympic medalist , were suspended for drug use , though both athletes have appealed . <p> " It 's business as usual , " said Charlie Francis , the coach whose world crashed right along with Johnson 's in Seoul . A former Canadian sprint champion , he had begun coaching Johnson in 1977 and introduced him to drugs four years later , convinced that most other leading athletes were also using them . After the Olympics , when the Canadian Government launched an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes , Francis became its star witness , testifying in brilliant detail about his own experiences with drugs and those of his athletes , making it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to that point . <p> These days the only athlete Francis coaches is his wife , Ange , a 24-year-old former high school champion hurdler and high jumper . Awaiting publication next month of his book , " Speed Trap , " Francis still harbors his old suspicions , that world-class sprinters are still using drugs , thus putting Johnson at an uncommon disadvantage . <p> " I 'm sure he can still run 10-flat , " he said of Johnson . " If I were with him , he could go under 10 on occasion , in season . At least , I think he could . " <p> Last July , Francis was replaced by Loren Seagrave , a 38-year-old former coach of women 's track at Louisiana State University who had guided his team to national indoor and outdoor titles in 1987 and 1989 , his last year at the school . In one respect , Seagrave was an unusual choice . The success of his athletes at L.S.U. generated rumors that he assisted their development with drugs . He has steadfastly denied the rumors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers , Kemeel Azan and the lawyer Edward Futerman , that won Seagrave the job as Francis 's successor . <p> " We were aware of the rumors , we told Loren we had heard them , " said Azan , a businessman in the Toronto area . " He denied them , and Canadian track and field officials preferred we not hire him . But we felt Loren had the skills and know-how Ben needed now . " <p> At first , it was a tenuous match . Johnson preferred no coach at all , and Seagrave , too , found it somewhat daunting at the start , given Johnson 's natural skills and the folly of tinkering with them . <p> " I think I 'm immensely well-qualified from a technical standpoint , " said Seagrave , who considers himself more a consultant than a coach . " But I did n't come here to make any drastic changes . What a foolish thing to do , with a training program that already produced such good results . " <p> In large part , Johnson 's training under Seagrave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on acceleration , speed and strength : the critical mix for any sprinter . <p> Still , certain other areas needed to be explored , foremost among them , determining how much of a workload Johnson could endure in training without drugs that allowed him to work harder and recover faster . <p> Through time , Johnson and Seagrave have become respectful of each other , though not nearly so close or friendly as Johnson and Francis had been . <p> " I miss him , " Johnson said of his former coach . " Right now , I ca n't associate with him . But I 'm sure after track and field is long gone , I 'll talk to him again and do things with him . But not right now . I ca n't . " <p> In fact , the emotional bonds connecting him to Francis have anything but disappeared . They still talk by telephone and even in person on those days Francis and his wife are working out at the training center , as they were one day last week . <p> At first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw him into the workout by saying , " You 've got to tell me what you think . " By the end of the sprint drills , the two were hunched at the far end of the track , stopwatches in hand , as Johnson streaked by . <p> " He was Ben 's coach , " Seagrave said later , almost apologetically . " I 'd be crazy not to ask him his opinion of things . " <p> Throughout the suspension , three motivating factors kept Johnson 's eyes riveted to the distant horizon of his return : Carl Lewis , world records and an Olympic gold medal . <p> He detests Lewis , though he never says so in public . " Beating Lewis is No. 1 , " Johnson said . " Whenever I beat him again in the next couple of years , he can always remember that . " <p> World records are possible , he said , but , as always , a function of the time , place and his physical condition . " The more races I run , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no doubt in my mind . " The same applies to a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona , Spain , when he will be five months short of 30 years old . " Age does n't matter , " he insisted . " Thirty years old is perfect for a good sprinter . " <p> Whether it 's all wishful thinking or reasonable expectations of the years ahead remains to be seen . Johnson has shown a remarkable resiliency just to reach the present in such sunny condition , having suffered far more than disgrace and the loss of untold millions in appearance fees , endorsement contracts and other commercial opportunities . When his father died of a heart attack in Jamaica , the family 's native country , about a year ago , Johnson felt the episode in Seoul had contributed to it . <p> " When things happened in Seoul , the next day , my mom told me I had a hard road ahead , with lots of ups and downs , " he said . " But she told me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me since I was a kid , I believed in her . She told me not to worry , that things would always come back in my favor . All I had to do was keep working at it and do the things I 'm doing . I believe her . Everything is going to work out in my favor . " 
##3000052 <p> NEW technology in the design and construction of skis over the last year has set the industry abuzz . <p> Some say the innovations represent the greatest revolution since Howard Head invented the metal ski 40 years ago . <p> Others say the changes are an outgrowth of work that began five years ago when the midsection of skis was narrowed and new base construction was introduced . <p> Whatever its genesis , the technology has brought a breed of skis to the market that promises to improve performance , at least enough to justify their extravagant price tags . Although these skis are so far designed for intermediate to expert skiers with few budget restraints , it is useful for all skiers to be aware of the newest developments . <p> A little information goes a long way in helping the buyer through the thicket of new ski design terms , such as " one-piece wraps " and " monocoque . " And this technology will have an impact on skis in the future . <p> In it 's simplest terms , the innovations join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a one-piece cap , like a bridge or an arch . And , like a bridge or an arch , pressure applied to any portion of the structure is immediately transferred to the outermost points , the edges of the ski . The result is that these new skis hold their edges on the snow better , turn more quickly and easily and are more stable . <p> Conventional skis are made of separate pieces for the top , sides and bottom that are joined to form a box . Inside the box are layers of wood , foam or other materials or a solid core of composite materials . This inner core is the main structural foundation of the ski ; the thing that determines its skiing characteristics -- flex distribution , torsional rigidity and weight -- and gives it holding , turning and running properties . <p> In the new skis , the structural element that determines skiing characteristics is the one-piece cap . But not all one-piece caps function in the same way and some skis with caps are still partly influenced by the inner core structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a one-piece cap design in limited quantity last season . The Volant one-piece topskin is made of stainless steel over a core of laminated wood with fiberglass and rubber layers to dampen the ski 's liveliness . Invented by Bucky Kashiwa , an engineer at National Labs in Los Alamos , N.M. , and a former pro racer , the steel cap allows more weight to be distributed from the center of the ski to the tip and tail . The designers claim the result is better edge holding and easier turning . <p> The Volants are designed for skiers of intermediate and above ability and come in four models -- FX One , FX Two , FX Three and FW One -- with stiffer to softer flex patterns . Elissa Slanger , a Squaw Valley , Calif. , instructor who tested Volants for Ski magazine called them " pleasant cruising skis for all kinds of snow . " The suggested retail price is $460 . <p> Salomon , known for bindings , boots and cross-country equipment , has spent $40 million on a monocoque ( or one shell ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equipe 's one-piece cap is a molded composite of fiberglass and Kevlar over a foam core . The sidewalls have an increasing slant toward the tip and tail . The designers claim that allows the ski to slice through snow better . <p> Recommended for experts and racers , three models are available -- giant slalom , slalom and super slalom -- depending on how much turning they like to do . But skiers select length by their body weight , ability and aggressiveness rather than the usual height measurement . <p> " Salomon 's power-rating system is confusing at first , " said David Dodge , a former pro racer who tested the skis , " but it makes sense and it 's important to follow it for best results . " The S9000 Equipes have a retail price of $595 . <p> The Elan MBX , which is a product of Yugoslavia , is also a monocoque ski with a rounded cap made of layers of fiberglass and Kevlar molded around a wood core . The skis come in only four lengths , but because the tail tapers more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , however , hamper the ski 's quick-turning or edge-holding characteristics , according to Rick Stalker , who managed a series of ski shops and tested the MBXs for Snow Country magazine . " It 's not too demanding , but very turny and holds very well , " said Stalker . " In fact , some skiers thought it was too turny . " Recommended as an all-around ski for advanced intermediates and up , the MBX sells for $550 . <p> The Fischer C.A.D. ( Concept Advanced Design ) does not function as a one-piece cap in the purest sense of the technology because the core as well as the shell determine the ski 's characteristics . The ski is made with a one-piece top of a plastic alloy that is bonded through a vacuum process over a carbon/graphite sock surrounding a wood core . <p> Dodge said the C.A.D. is one of the best all-around skis with excellent edge-hold , and recommends them for upper-intermediate to advanced skiers . The C.A.D. sells for $650 . <p> The Kastle X 1 Integral uses a similar process to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molded over a wood core . But Kastle has altered the shape of the ski 's top to give rounder and smoother turns when the ski is flexed on the snow . Another unusual characteristic is a series of ribs molded into the tail to provide torsional rigidity and a fast exit from turns . <p> Stalker said this ski would perform well on a wide variety of terrain , but is best on softer snow . Designed with good to excellent skiers in mind , the X 1 Integral sells for $550 . <p> Though they have similar structural characteristics , these new skis do not ski alike . In fact , many people who tried them said they often had fewer similarities than are found in more conventional skis made by different manufacturers . Before investing in these high-end models , skiers are advised to give them a test from demo vans or rentals at ski area shops . <p> Better yet , wait a few years . Like past ski innovations , designers say this technology is the leading edge of what will be found in many lower-priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap designs can be found at the following ski shops in the metropolitan area : Scandinavian Ski Shop , Manhattan ; Summit Ski &; Sport , Summit , N.J. ; Ski Stop , Plainview , N.J. ; Ski Barn , Little Falls , N.J. ; Pedigree Ski Shop , White Plains , N.Y. ; Princeton Ski Outlet , Elmsford , Queens ; Hickory and Tweed , Armonk , N.Y. ; Sno Haus , Huntington Station , L.I. ; White Mountain , Great Neck , L.I . 
##3000053 <p> WHEN the Knicks ' locker-room door opened after the game on Thursday night in Portland , Ore. , Patrick Ewing braced himself for the inevitable group of reporters waiting . He had ice bags on both knees , a few scars on his body , but fewer concerns about the Knicks on his mind . <p> The Knicks ' eight-day West Coast trip was over with a 3-1 record , a morale booster for Ewing and the Knicks . And Ewing had continued to play at a level that makes him arguably the best center in the National Basketball Association , and definitely one of the league 's best players . <p> Heading into last night 's game against Philadelphia in Madison Square Garden , Ewing was among the league leaders in scoring ( 28.6 ) , rebounding ( 12.6 ) and blocked shots ( 4.88 ) . <p> Many people thought it would be impossible for Ewing to improve over last season , when he averaged 28.6 points , 10.9 rebounds and 3.99 blocks . But so far he has been better , a tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the season . Ewing often arrives at practice 90 minutes early to lift weights , even on the mornings after games . <p> Yet , the Knicks ' early season has already had its highs and lows . When New York got off to a 1-2 start , Ewing appeared frustrated , and commented publicly for the first time that he was unhappy with the progress of contract negotiations with the Knicks . <p> Ewing , who is eligible to become a restricted free agent at the end of this season , is seeking a new multimillion-dollar contract that would allow him to finish his career in New York . Neither the Knicks , nor David Falk , Ewing 's attorney , have said much about the negotiations , hoping to keep the details private . <p> In the meantime , Ewing 's main objective is to help the Knicks be the best team possible , a team good enough to contend for the championship . A private individual , Ewing prefers to let his play do the talking . And right now , his play reflects a determined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ewing 's week on the West Coast . <p> Sacramento , Calif. , Nov. 9-10 -- When the Knicks arrived on a Friday afternoon , the weather was picturesque , 80 degrees and a cloudless sky . Yet after flying for more than five hours , the players grabbed a quick bite , then boarded a bus to practice at a local gym . The floor was slippery and practice was not good . Stu Jackson , the coach , allowed Ewing and Charles Oakley to sit out practice . Because they are physical players , because they play a lot of minutes , and because they spend most of their time in the low post , Ewing and Oakley take more punishment than anyone else on the team . So occasionally , Jackson gives them a day off . <p> That logic looked like a stroke of genius the next night when New York played the Sacramento Kings . It was obvious after the opening quarter that Ewing and Oakley would have to play long minutes if the Knicks were going to win . Perhaps affected by the long trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbling passes . They committed 23 turnovers . The Kings were no better , shooting 38.8 percent and missing 10 of 32 free throws . It was an ugly game . <p> But in the fourth quarter , Ewing was at his best , scoring 8 of his 24 points to help squeeze out a 93-88 victory . He also contributed 13 rebounds and 5 blocked shots . <p> After the game , a reporter asked Jackson where the Knicks would be without Ewing . Jackson rolled his eyes and said , " I do n't even want to think about that . " <p> Meanwhile , two young boys who wanted to meet Ewing were escorted into the locker room . Ewing shook hands with both , then playfully asked which one was the better basketball player . The taller youngster raised his hand , but the other youngster said , " I 'm pretty good , too . " Ewing laughed . <p> The Knicks ' victory also brightened his mood , but there was no time to celebrate . Less than 24 hours later , New York would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif , Nov. 11-12 -- Playing the Lakers brought out the best in the Knicks . They played poised and confident basketball and won , 109-103 . Ewing was typically outstanding : 27 points , 14 rebounds , 6 assists and 3 blocked shots . But he had plenty of assistance from his teammates , particularly Kiki Vandeweghe , who scored 10 of his 22 points in the final five and a half minutes . <p> After the game , a subdued Magic Johnson was trying to explain the Lakers ' third loss in four games . In the other locker room , Ewing was begining to feel good about the Knicks , not only because they won , but also because so many people played well . <p> " The Lakers may be having problems , but they still have Magic Johnson and James Worthy , " Ewing said . " Anytime we can beat a team with those two guys on it , especially on the road , I feel good . This was a big win . It 's a good sign for us . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' outstanding forward , had this to say in The Seattle Times about what he expected from Ewing and the Knicks ' offense : <p> " Pat 's going to be the focal point . Pat goes from one block to the other , and everybody else watches . It 's like Gladys Knight and the Pips . " <p> It was a clever line by McDaniel , but he found it to be untrue . The Knicks won an emotional game in overtime , 116-110 , giving them a perfect 3-0 record on the trip . <p> Despite 28 points , 8 rebounds and 3 blocks , Ewing said after the game , " I do n't think I had a good game , but the rest of the team played real well . " <p> Ewing was half right , because the rest of the team did play well , especially Gerald Wilkins ( 22 points ) and the entire bench , which combined for 34 points . <p> " One more game and we can go home , " Ewing said . " No matter what happens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . " <p> Portland , Nov. 14-15 -- Jackson gave the entire team a day off on Wednesday . It did not help . Portland rolled to a 141-125 victory , the undefeated Trail Blazers ' seventh triumph . Ewing had 27 points and 9 rebounds , but with the game out of reach , he did not play most of the final period . <p> As he thought about the long trip home , Ewing has this to say about the state of the Knicks : <p> " The trip was great , but we have a lot of work to do . The season is still young . Last year we were killing people in the first half of the season , then we took a nose dive . We have to stay focused and keep working . <p> ' We 're going to try not to let what happened last year happen again . All the talk and the media and the controversy last year were distractions . We 're going to try and stay away from that . " <p> When asked if the chemistry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not sure yet because it 's too early . But we 're playing very well for the most part . We 're hitting the open man . Kiki has been playing tremendously . Everybody has been contributing . " <p> Does he think the Knicks depend on him too much to win ? Ewing smiled as he prepared to leave the locker room , perhaps keeping his innermost thoughts to himself . <p> " Some people are always going to find fault with any situation , " Ewing said . " I just worry about playing , to do the best that I possibly can to win . That 's all I can do . My goal is to win . If we keep winning , I 'll be happy . " 
##3000054 <p> THE phrase has been so widely used in the last year or so , it has already become a cliche . But when Herk Robinson , the new general manager of the Kansas City Royals , uttered the words , he did n't even realize he was using them . <p> " Bo knows , " Robinson said , " what he has to do . He does n't need anybody telling him every five minutes . He deserves credit . He has become a more disciplined hitter and a smarter hitter . " <p> The phenomenon known as Bo Jackson has said he will end his two-sport life when his wife and children say they want him to spend more time at home . Only then , he says , will he decide which sport to retire and which to retain . Although Jackson has always liked to confound people , taking the path he is least expected to follow , it 's obvious that when the time comes , he will choose baseball . <p> His steadily improving performance for the Royals screams out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League will have an assortment of running backs of the caliber of Bo Jackson . In a few years , baseball will have very few players with the ability Bo Jackson will have . <p> The development of Bo the baseball player can be seen in various ways , including this annual look at baseball 's contact averages . This is an unofficial statistic limited to players who strike out 100 or more times in a season . The idea is to subtract the strikeouts and determine how good the hitter is when he hits the ball , when he makes contact . <p> This last season 37 players struck out at least 100 times . Just as he led in home runs with 51 , Cecil Fielder led the major leagues in strikeouts with 182 . His batting average was .277 , but in the 391 times he made contact , he emerged with a .407 average . <p> Although that is an outstanding contact average , it was n't the best in the majors . Jose Canseco , who batted .274 over all , led all 100-strikeout hitters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , Jackson placed third , this time , though , with a career-best .397 . He attained that personal plateau by combining a career-high batting average of .272 with a career-low strikeout total of 128 . In his first full season , 1987 , Jackson struck out once every 2.51 times at bat ; his ratio this year was once every 3.16 , virtually the same as Fielder 's 3.15 . His improvement in making contact did not go unnoticed . <p> " It 's just a case of Bo adapting and adjusting as he plays more baseball , " Robinson said . " That 's the reason people would like to see him play baseball full time . It was n't a case of a hitting coach working with him or standing closer to the plate or holding his hands differently ; it was just a case of becoming a more intelligent baseball player . I think Bo always will strike out more than most hitters ; power hitters do . But I think he 'll continue to reduce the number of strikeouts . " <p> Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in runs batted in , from 105 to 78 , and he still had more strikeouts than hits . Of the 37 contact-average players , 14 struck out more often than they hit safely . The leaders of the subgroup were Mickey Tettleton ( 160 strikeouts , 99 hits ) and Rob Deer ( 147 and 92 ) . <p> At the other extreme , Willie McGee had the biggest difference with 199 hits and 104 strikeouts , followed by Dave Parker ( 176 and 102 ) and Bobby Bonilla ( 175 and 103 ) . <p> Even without their strikeouts being counted , three players in the group did not achieve a .300 average . Howard Johnson and Devon White each had a .294 contact average and Gary Gaetti was lowest at .277 . Trade Him ? <p> Given Jackson 's impressive development , it would be highly unlikely that the Royals would trade him , but that possibility was the subject of a recent rumor . <p> " We have not talked to anyone about trading him , " Robinson said . " In all candor , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was an overwhelming deal for our club , we 'd have to listen . But we have no intent of trading Bo . He 's valuable here . He 's meant a great deal to this club and he 's getting better . " <p> The general manager said the Royals did not intend to take a stand on Jackson 's two-sport career . " He knows his abilities better than anyone , " Robinson said . " He shows up the first day of spring training , and he 's always given 100 percent when he 's here . We have guys who do a lot of things in the off season . His is just a little unique . " <p> Jackson 's fellow outfielder Danny Tartabull is a perennial topic of conversation in trade talks , but Robinson said he was n't going anywhere so fast . <p> " Danny has a lot of ability , but the last couple years have n't been years he 's been happy with , mostly because of injuries , " Robinson said . " Coming off this season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , especially because he 's going into his sixth year . But we still have confidence in his ability . " <p> Robinson said he spent some time with Tartabull last month and was satisfied with his outlook . <p> " We 're not out shopping him around , " the Royals ' executive said . " He represents a lot of offense . We do n't have much offense . And we also have to be aware of the possibility that Bo could get hurt playing football . " Glenn Davis on the Block <p> Talk among general managers is that the Houston Astros are prepared to trade Glenn Davis , their power-hitting first baseman , for younger , less expensive players . The Astros have to sign Davis to a lucrative multiyear contract or face losing him as a free agent after next season . <p> They care for neither alternative so they will try to swap him for a package of less experienced players who are ready to play in the major leagues and minor league prospects . Davis , who hits home runs in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run hitter in the American League . <p> The California Angels are said to be on the verge of trading White , their disappointing outfielder , for a starting second baseman , perhaps Jerry Browne of Cleveland . The Indians are supposedly thinking about moving Felix Fermin from shortstop to second and using a rookie , Mark Lewis , at short . The Indians are not happy with Browne 's work on turning double plays . <p> The Indians also are shopping Cory Snyder , their disappointing right fielder , and they have mentioned Greg Swindell , a left-handed pitcher , who has not matched his potential . <p> The Boston Red Sox initially accepted inquiries about Mike Greenwell , but have apparently had second thoughts . Manager Joe Morgan has said the club would " feel funny " trading its left fielder . Robinson on Strawberry <p> Bill Robinson was a Mets coach for six of Darryl Strawberry 's eight years with the team , and he knew his shortcomings better than most , particularly his defensive problems . That 's why he was asked about Strawberry 's offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles Dodgers . <p> " I really do n't think he would be a good center fielder , " said Robinson , now a television commentator . " He does n't have those great instincts . He 's a little better than average , but not above average and I think you have to be above average to play center field . " <p> Robinson , a former outfielder himself , said if Strawberry played center he would have to set himself differently . <p> " He has a habit of putting one foot in front of the other , " Robinson related . " We 're mostly taught to keep both feet even at shoulders width . He 'll just have to work harder , anticipate the ball getting hit to him more , although I think it might be a little easier to play center because you can see the ball pitched to the batter and the ball , when it 's hit to you , is straighter . Those things will be easier for him . He has fairly good instincts and he has speed . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason he plays so deep . " He does n't go back well after a ball , " the former coach said . " That 's one thing he 'll have to cope with . 
##3000055 <p> GEORGE MIKAN chuckled when asked recently what would have happened to a 6-foot-10-inch player of his day who launched a set shot during a game or , worse yet , attempted to break a press or create his own shot by dribbling the ball . <p> " He 'd get bawled out , of course , " said Mikan , who is generally regarded as the first great center in the modern era of professional basketball . <p> At 6-10 , 240 pounds , Mikan dominated the game at each end of the floor , first at DePaul , later as a prolific scorer with the Minneapolis Lakers . For all of his prominence , however , Mikan said he always remembered never to cross the invisible line that separated centers from everyone else on the team . <p> " The only time I would shoot from the outside was in practice , and then it was only when we were shooting for milkshakes , " Mikan recalled . " And as far as ball handling goes , I always said that when I dribbled , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mikan is flabbergasted by the transformations taking place at his position , with centers becoming involved in every facet of the game , especially at the college level . Had he been at McDonough Arena last week , Mikan would have seen Alonzo Mourning , Georgetown 's 6-10 center , playing on the periemter , taking an occasional 15-foot jump shot , racing down court to block a forward 's shot on the wing , then streaking back down court to finish off a fast break . <p> " I think it 's wonderful , " said Mikan , who retired in 1955 and is a lawyer in Minnesota . " You have guys running like deer ; they 're bigger , well-coordinated and they can do an awful lot of things . When I played , it was the center 's duty to be within 10 feet of the basket . " <p> Would he have liked to take outside shots ? <p> " Heck yes ; a center always likes to shoot like a guard , " he said . " But that just was n't my thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center position is on the verge of being liberated from the image of the lumbering bulldozer that has haunted the position virtually since Dr. Naismith erected his first peach basket . <p> The changing roles can be seen clearly in college where coaches , faced with an ever-present shortage of true centers , have adopted an array of systems -- like the passing game and motion offenses -- that involve all five players and demand fluency in a variety of skills . <p> Increasingly , the big man is no longer treated like a leper on a fast break or regarded as a liability in a fast-paced game . As often as not , the modern-day center is likely to be leading the break . <p> Last season , Nevada-Las Vegas won the national collegiate title with a style in which the traditional center position was adapted to their breakneck , running offense , while Loyola Marymount set records , won fans and advanced to the quarterfinals of the tournament with an offense in which every position operated in overdrive . <p> While fans enjoy this bourgeoning versatility at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a game that places a premium on height , the tallest people are moving further away from the basket . <p> " Nobody wants to be a center , " said Bob Wentzel , the head basketball coach at Rutgers . " Centers want to be power forwards ; power forwards want to be small forwards ; small forwards want to be guards and everybody wants to be the point guard . You want to know where the centers are ? Ask Magic , he screwed it all up . " <p> Most coaches agree that the appearance of Magic Johnson , a 6-9 guard for Michigan State , and Larry Bird , a 6-9 swingman for Indiana State , in the 1979 N.C.A.A. final accelerated the trend of players over 6-8 focusing on skills like ball handling , passing and long-range shooting that had been reserved for smaller players . <p> After Johnson and Bird , several college coaches began to put more stock in a player 's skills than the physical package in which they were wrapped . <p> " It more depends on a person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head coach at Georgetown . " Years ago , we used to put the smallest man on the team at point guard , the biggest guy at center , the next to the smallest in another position . Now you do it according to his ability or his talents . Athletes are bigger , stronger , quicker . The game is played much more differently than the way it was played . " <p> Mourning is a prime example of how liberation of the pivot position has affected even those players who were quite comfortable playing with their backs to the basket . <p> Four years ago , Mourning was regarded as the nation 's premier high school center . Mourning said then that he saw himself first and foremost as a low-post player and was not particularly taken with the perimeter game . <p> Now , the 6-10 junior is learning to play power forward , a position that has become almost interchangeable with center , but one that also calls for the dexterity associated with a small forward . <p> Mourning will split the pivot with Dikembe Mutombo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , Mourning has taken a sabbatical from the position to become more adept at facing the basket , passing , floating back and forth between the perimeter and the blocks and hitting the outside shot . <p> On defense he is learning to make the difficult adjustment in man-to-man alignment , guarding more versatile tall players in the open court . While some of his shooting percentage and offensive rebounding statistics may suffer , Mourning is broadening his skills to meet the changing norms of his position . <p> " I still see myself as a center , I 'll always see myself as a center , " he said . " But it 's good to know the functions of the other position on the floor , especially the forward spot . " <p> Thompson thinks that Mourning will benefit from expanding his skills , even when he plays the post by himself , by learning how to come out and get the ball when the guards ca n't get it to him and hitting the 15-foot jumper to keep collapsing defenses honest . <p> " Alonzo is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's an extraordinary shot blocker and rebounder . Now he 's being afforded an opportunity to broaden his game . He 's got to learn defensive movements outside that he 's forced to do that he ordinarily would n't have done . " <p> The new versatility at the pivot has sparked debates among coaches over whether bringing the center in from the cold has been good for the game . Not everyone is convinced it has . <p> John Wooden , the legendary U.C.L.A. coach whose teams won 10 national championships , thinks that the advent of the 6-10 player who can do it all has caused a deterioration of teamwork . <p> " As the individual becomes more proficient they can do more on their own and coaches let them do more on their own , thus team play has deteriorated , " he said . <p> Wooden coached two of the most outstanding centers in college basketball , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , then known as Lew Alcindor , and Bill Walton . Yet he fit them tightly into the framework of a team and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 's . <p> Wooden recalled that when Abdul-Jabbar first came to U.C.L.A. , he was asked about the center 's versatility . <p> " People used to ask me , ' Can he shoot from the outside ? ' I said ' I do n't know and I 'm not going to find out . ' I had other fellows that I would rather have shooting outside . I 'd rather have him underneath . " <p> Coaches like Thompson have become more open to allowing skills to dictate position . " Magic came in the gym to work out with our kids during the preseason , " he said . " Magic may be bigger than everybody on our team , yet you see a guy like Magic getting out on the break handling the ball you realize that it depends more on a person 's ability than his size . What are you going to tell Magic , ' Play center ? ' " <p> Wooden said that is exactly what he would have told Johnson . " I 'd say , ' I 've got a 6-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe not as well as you can , but you can play the front line much better than he can . So because of the sum total of the two of you , the group is going to be more , and that is what I 'm always interested in : the sum total . " <p> An increasing number of coaches have discovered is that having five players who can run the floor , shoot , dribble and pass is more lethal , particularly when two or three of them are 6-10 or taller . <p> At Arizona this season , Coach Lute Olson has a front line of the 6-11 Brian Williams , the 6-11 Sean Rooks and the 7-foot Ed Stokes , whom he uses coming off the bench . <p> Of the three , Stokes is the more traditional center ; Williams and Rooks have solid inside games but enjoy the flourish in the transition game . <p> " If Brian intercepts a pass he can go from one end to the other and score , " Olson said . " There 's only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What 's happening is part of an evolution in that all players are working to become more flexible in what they are doing . It 'll still drive you crazy but it 's good in the long run . Players are working harder to improve their skills . The big players are not willing to fall in a rut where they say , ' O.K. , I 'm the center ; I set up on the blocks and wait for somebody to toss me the ball . ' " <p> There has always been a shortage of truly outstanding centers , but what aggravates the condition now , coaches say , is that so many high school players do not want to be strictly post-up players . <p> " With the advent of guys like Magic , everybody wants to move , " said Jim Harrick , the U.C.L.A. coach . " Teams are playing uptempo and kids are , too . If you go into a center 's home , he says , ' I do n't want to play center . ' They do n't realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The liberation movement has not taken the N.B.A. by storm . Post play is like wrestling at best and more routinely like combat . So while general managers appreciate the newly evolved versatility of big men , the reality is that in the knuckle culture of pro basketball , muscle ultimately wins out . <p> While the center has shifted out of the middle , players like Mourning and Shaquille O'Neal , the 7-foot L.S.U. center , have shunned the extravagances of versatility in favor of remaining in the trenches . <p> " First of all , they pay the center the most money ; that 's the bottom line right there , " Mourning said . " Traditionally you 've seen that the big money is given to the centers . Not only that , centers are looked at more than any other position on the floor . The center can have a major effect on another team 's play , especially if he 's able to pass , hit cutters , block shots and rebound . <p> " When you think of center , " Mourning added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

##3000057 <p> The PGA Tour could be forced to shift as many as 11 of its tournaments next year because of the refusal of private all-white clubs to comply with professional golf 's new antidiscrimination policy , a tour official said yesterday . <p> Tim Finchem , deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the PGA Tour , said the tour was still negotiating with six clubs over the new policy , trying to persuade them to alter membership practices to be more open to minority-group members and women . <p> Speaking by telephone from the organization 's headquarters in Ponte Vedra , Fla. , Finchem said three of these sites were on the Senior PGA Tour , two were on the regular tour and one was on the Ben Hogan Tour , a sort of minor league circuit . Five Out Already <p> Five clubs have already dropped out as 1991 tournament sites rather than conform to the tour 's new antidiscrimination policy , which was released on Aug. 3 . The guidelines were drawn up after corporate sponsors withdrew more than $2 million of television advertising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at the Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham , Ala . Civil rights groups had threatened to picket the all-white club , which bowed to pressure and admitted an honorary black member before the tournament . <p> If the six clubs still negotiating over the policy refuse to conform to the tour 's directive , the respective tournament sponsors will be forced to find new sites before contracts for 1991 can be signed . <p> " I would say two of the clubs are on the bubble , in about the 50-50 range as far as agreeing to terms , " Finchem said of the six clubs , which he declined to name . " The other four are about 75 percent ready to sign . We may very well lose a couple of them , but we are hopeful we wo n't . " <p> The five clubs that have already withdrawn are Cypress Point , one of the longtime sites of the A.T . &T.; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am ; Butler National , former site of the Centel Western Open , near Chicago ; Old Warson Country Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell Classic on the Senior Tour ; the Skokie ( Ill . ) Country Club , the proposed site of the Ameritech Senior Open , and the Amarillo Country Club , the former site of the Ben Hogan Amarillo Open . Alternate sites have been found for those events . Resolving the Contracts <p> Of the 118 events that were co-sponsored by the PGA Tour this year , more than 50 were held at private clubs , many of which have only white members . Finchem said the tour expected to have resolved all its contracts by the first week in December . <p> " Usually , we 're done with the contracts by late October or early November , " he said . " But the infusion of this issue has slowed down the overall process . " <p> The results are being watched closely by some of the civil rights leaders who led the protest against Shoal Creek . In addition to naming an honorary black member , the club later invited a second black man to become a full member . He is in the process of joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Christian Leadership Conference , said civil rights groups would not hesitate to take the same action they took before the tournament at Shoal Creek if the tour failed to hold all-white country clubs to its policy of racial inclusiveness . <p> " I think the tour ought to require that each club that hosts a tournament in 1991 have a black member , " Lowery said Wednesday , speaking by telephone from Atlanta . " If Shoal Creek could move with dispatch and a sense of urgency , then these other all-white clubs can also . They 've had six months since Shoal Creek . That is ample time for any club that is serious about desegregating . " <p> But Finchem said the tour 's guidelines did not require that a club have a black person , a member of another minority group or a woman as a full member in order to conform . The antidiscrimination policy statement says that clubs that show evidence of exclusionary membership practices will be required only to " take appropriate action to encourage minority membership . " Black Members Not the Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a club have a black member , " Finchem said . " We do n't view that as the test . What we do view as the test is antidiscriminatory activity and effort that is documented . " <p> Finchem stressed that the specific conditions of conformity would vary from club to club , according to the history of its membership practices and the demographics of its community . <p> " We 've found that no two clubs are alike , " Finchem said . " Where there is a history of specific accusations by the community of past discrimination , then we would hold that club to a higher standard . <p> " Conversely , if a club has made a strong effort to recruit minority membership but is still without minority membership , we will take that into consideration . " In Touch With Lowery <p> He cited as an example the Castle Pines Golf Club near Denver , site of the International tourney . That club has offered memberships to blacks at the regular initiation fee , but has found no takers . <p> Finchem said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that he was surprised at the civil rights leader 's opinion that each private club that acts as a PGA Tour host should have at least one black member . <p> " He has n't said that to us , " Finchem said . " We recognize why that solution was employed at Shoal Creek . That situation carried highly visible evidence of discrimination . " An Important Act <p> Lowery , who has urged the PGA Tour commissioner , Deane Beman , and the P.G.A . of America executive director , Jim Awtrey , to hire more minority-group members for their staffs , believes that the act of admitting a black member is important in breaking down discriminatory attitudes . <p> He disagreed with the recent argument used by the Aronimink Country Club , which last week withdrew as the host of the 1993 P.G.A . Championship , that it is unfair to move minority members into memberships ahead of others who have been on waiting lists to join private clubs . <p> The issue of discrimination at private clubs received further attention this week when the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Thursday that any club wishing to play host to one of the 13 U.S.G.A. championships must have a nonexclusionary membership policy . 
##3000058 <p> When Bud Carson sought out Jim Shofner in February to revive the Cleveland Browns ' erratic and lethargic offense , he could not have envisioned that Shofner would eventually preside over more than just the offense . <p> " The first thing that impressed me about Jim is the success he 's had with some other teams , " Carson said when he hired Shofner . " And it was n't always in the best of circumstances . " <p> After the team 's 2-7 start , Art Modell , the Browns ' owner , dismissed Carson on Nov. 5 and named Shofner interim head coach . After a bye week , Shofner will make his pro head coaching debut when Cleveland plays host to Houston ( 4-5 ) on Sunday . <p> But once again , he is not in the best of circumstances . <p> The Browns have sloshed through the season . Among their seven losses are shutouts by Kansas City ( 34-0 ) and Buffalo ( 42-0 ) . Since a 13-3 season-opening victory over Pittsburgh , the Cleveland defense has allowed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decayed and offensive production has been poor ; only twice this season has Cleveland scored 21 or more points . <p> Shofner , who will turn 55 years old on Dec. 18 , was a defensive back for the Browns from 1958 through 1963 . His pro coaching career spans 23 years , including stops with the 49ers ( 1967-73 and ' 77 ) , the Browns ( 1978-80 ) , the Oilers ( 1981-82 ) , the Cowboys ( 1983-85 ) and the Cardinals ( 1986-89 ) . He was the head coach at Texas Christian University from 1974 through 1976 . <p> Brian Sipe , the former Browns ' quarterback , once said of Shofner : " Jim was the best quarterback coach I ever had . He has a good football mind . He 's one of the most levelheaded persons I 've ever been around . He was at his best in the fourth quarter of tight games . " <p> Tight fourth-quarter games have not been a Browns specialty this season . Their last game was the Buffalo debacle . Houston , which was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jets ( 17-12 ) and the Rams ( 17-13 ) . <p> Shofner has reinstated Bernie Kosar at quarterback . He has returned Eric Metcalf to running back from wide receiver and named Metcalf a starter over the rookie Leroy Hoard . He has also set a more rigid and briefer schedule of meetings and practices ; a chief criticism of Carson was that he altered his schedules from week to week . Most of all , Shofner has tried to lessen the tension-filled atmosphere around the Browns , hoping that the talent will surface that led Cleveland to the American Conference championship game last season . <p> " I 'd like to think we 'll be a little more wide open , particularly in the early part of ball games , " Shofner said . " We 've gotten ourselves behind a lot and that has hurt us . I know that failure breeds failure and success breeds success . So we need to put the best players out there to steer the tide . " LOCAL TEAMS <p> Detroit ( 3-6 ) at Giants ( 9-0 ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led the Giants by 7-3 at halftime . They compiled 410 yards on offense by game 's end and Bob Gagliano threw for 344 yards , including a 71-yard touchdown pass to Richard Johnson . The Giants prevailed , however , 24-14 . <p> That must seem like light years ago for the Lions . <p> Detroit has dropped three of its last four games . Its run-and-shoot offense has sputtered under a revolving trio of quarterbacks and its defense allowed 38 or more points in losses to Tampa Bay , Kansas City and Washington . Every strength that the Giants have -- especially continuity and confidence -- the Lions lack . Jets ( 4-6 ) at Indianapolis ( 3-6 ) <p> The Jets wonder where their promising offense has gone and why the ball too often seems to bounce the wrong way . Indianapolis knows the feeling : its 13-10 victory over New England snapped a three-game losing streak and may have prevented a complete collapse . <p> The Colts ' defense should provide a remedy for the Jets ' offensive woes . Indianapolis has forced only 15 turnovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing defense . NATIONAL CONFERENCE <p> New Orleans ( 4-5 ) at Washington ( 5-4 ) <p> " I do n't know if we 've ever been more banged up after a game than this , " Joe Gibbs said after the Monday night thumping in Philadelphia . Nine Redskins were injured and three went on injured reserve , including Stan Humphries ( knee ) and Gerald Riggs ( foot ) . <p> The quickly improving Saints march into Washington hoping to create more havoc for the Redskins : they lead the conference in sacks with 27 and have allowed only 92.3 rushing yards and 192.8 passing yards per game . Philadelphia ( 5-4 ) at Atlanta ( 3-6 ) <p> Buddy Ryan said the Eagles ' defense " was even more awesome than I thought " after watching films of the Eagles ' victory over Washington . The Falcons say the effort and the big hits are there but the victories just keep slipping away . What happens when two teams often accused of cheap shots and late blows meet ? They brawl . Tampa Bay ( 4-6 ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place for the Buccaneers to be while on a four-game losing streak . With San Francisco seeking a league-record-tying 18th straight victory , Sunday could be an ugly day for the Buccaneers . Dallas ( 3-7 ) at Rams ( 3-6 ) <p> The Rams are out of sync and nearly out of sight in the wild-card chase . Dallas needs offense ; the Rams need defense . Green Bay ( 4-5 ) at Phoenix ( 2-7 ) <p> Finally the Packers are holding on to the football ; they did not fumble while beating the Raiders . That was the first time this season that Green Bay did not fumble in a game . AMERICAN CONFERENCE <p> San Diego ( 5-5 ) at Kansas City ( 5-4 ) <p> A pivotal game for both teams with the Raiders ' divisional lead shrinking . <p> The Chiefs are still stunned by Seattle 's desperation , last-second winning pass , which ruined Derrick Thomas 's record-setting seven-sack performance . San Diego thinks run first with the conference 's No. 1 rushing offense . Pittsburgh ( 5-4 ) at Cincinnati ( 5-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense has never been feared ( it ranks last in the conference ) and its offense has sagged in successive losses to Atlanta ( 38-17 ) and New Orleans ( 21-7 ) . Pittsburgh 's defense , however , wo n't run and hide and Bubby Brister can answer on offense . INTERCONFERENCE <p> Chicago ( 8-1 ) at Denver ( 3-6 ) <p> Mike Ditka told Lemuel Stinson to cool it for the remainder of the season after the cornerback 's war of words with the Atlanta Falcons set the tone for an intense , hard-hitting and jabbering game . <p> Dan Reeves wishes his headaches were as minor . John Elway said this week what many believed last year , that Bobby Humphrey 's addition at running back should not have cut into Elway 's role . Chicago adeptly snuffs the run . Elway ( eight touchdown passes , eight interceptions ) needs to break out here . Will Reeves allow him ? Minnesota ( 3-6 ) at Seattle ( 4-5 ) <p> Seattle has not allowed a rushing touchdown in its last seven games . Minnesota has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . New England ( 1-8 ) at Buffalo ( 8-1 ) <p> Opposites attract . When this game is over , few doubt the teams will still be going in opposite directions . MONDAY NIGHT <p> Raiders ( 6-3 ) at Miami ( 8-1 ) <p> Both teams hope this is a preview of the Amercian Conference championship game . The Raiders are not reeling , but two straight losses have dimmed their flame . The Raiders still love big games and show up big in Monday night affairs : They are easily a league-best 27-6-1 on Monday nights . <p> Jay Schroeder hears the boos and cries for his benching , but Art Shell said , " No amount of booing or the press will dictate who plays where . " Miami hopes to strut its stuff and beat a legitimate title contender . With two victories over New England , two over the Jets , and one each over Indianapolis and Phoenix , the Dolphins still have doubters .
