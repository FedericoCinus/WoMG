Correspondent Bernard Goldberg is back with a new feature , 48 HOURS With -- 48 HOURS with newsmakers , personalities and others . To mark his return , Bernie decided to find himself a good attorney . @!BERNARD-GOLDBERG-r : Why do you suppose so many Americans despise defense lawyers ? @!Ms-LESLIE-ABRAMSON : Because they do n't understand our role . They think we approve of what our clients do , when , of course , we don't. @!GOLDBERG : But the reason they think you approve is because you 're trying to get someone off , even if he did do it . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Well , I think if you -- if you substitute the word ' off ' with ' get a fair trial , ' that 's absolutely true . What would we think of a society where the defense lawyer is not on your side . Would do call such a system ? The Third Reich ? Do we call it Soviet Russia ? @(Footage-of-'Shut-u) @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrasive and a lot worse . And like a lot of other defense lawyers , she could n't care less . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : And that 's as bad as it is . That 's the worst thing anybody can say he ever did to his parents before he was driven over the edge . @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) We first got to know her during the Menendez trial . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : This is a televised trial . And it 's televised nationally . @(Footage-of-Lyle-an) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) The Menendez brothers , Lyle and Erik , at first denied and then admitted shotgunning their parents to death in their Beverly Hills home . @!Mr-LYLE-MENENDEZ-@ : I ran around and shot my mom . @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) It was self-defense , Abramson argues . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : The fact is they 're not really planning to kill their parents . They 're planning to defend themselves and hope it does n't come to that . @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) The boys , she said , had a deathly fear of their father who they claim sexually abused them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Ms-ABRAMSON : It 's right there . It 's reprinted . His hand is in his child 's crotch. @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) When people say they do n't like defense lawyers , there 's a good chance Leslie Abramson is one of the defense lawyers they do n't like . @(Footage-of-Abramso) @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Now if you want to believe that he killed his parents so that he could get a stainless steel Rolex watch , I can not stop you . @(Footage-of-Abramso) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) We talked at her law office in Los Angeles about her new book , " The Defense Is Ready " and about why so many Americans think more of used car dealers than they do of criminal defense lawyers . You know the joke about ' How do you know when is a lawyer lying ? You know , her lips are moving . ' That 's a joke . Nobody ... @!Ms-ABRAMSON : It 's not a joke . It reflects a negative attitude by society . Do they think we really want criminals running loose on the street , victimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good question . Here 's what I think : that all you care about is getting your client off whether he did it or not , whether he 's a bad person or not , whether he 's going to go out and do it again or not . You just want to get your client off . I think that 's what a lot of people think . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : It is our job to make sure the procedure is fair , the evidence is truthful , it 's real , it is n't fake , it is n't a lie , it is n't made up , it is n't planted , it is n't manufactured . All of those things have happened over the years and still happen every day . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Menende Unidentified Judge : The court finds that the jury is hopelessly deadlocked. @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) The first Menendez trial ended in a hung jury . @(Footage-of-CBS-new) @!HARRY-SMITH-@1Anch : Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez have been ordered to spend the rest of their lives in prison . @(Footage-of-second-) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sentenced to life in prison without parole . To Leslie Abramson , the conviction and the sentence were a travesty of justice . And if you listen to her today , she makes it sound like the whole judicial system is a travesty of justice , starting with the police . You wrote about the police , ' The general rule is cops lie . ' @!Ms-ABRAMSON : You know when I came to believe it ? When I became friends with ex-cops. @!GOLDBERG : What did the ex-cops tell you ? @!Ms-ABRAMSON : That they lie . They do n't teach it in the academy . They learn it , the little coplets , the rookies learn it the minute they get assigned to a station and get a partner and that 's when they 're told ' how we do things . ' They see it happening . They say nothing , they do nothing . The code of silence is absolutely true . @!GOLDBERG : What about the argument , ' Yeah , you 're talking about a few bad apples ' ? @!Ms-ABRAMSON : No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a few good apples . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Menende Judge : The court will call the case of People vs . Menendez. @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) You are not a fan of a lot of judges , either . Let me -- let me read to you ... @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Sadly , no. @!GOLDBERG : ... what you said in your book . You said that , ' An astonishing number of judges are remarkably stupid , totally crazy or deplorably lazy . ' @!Ms-ABRAMSON : I was talking about what I saw when I started practicing . I wanted to look up there and see a father or mother figure hand down the wisdom . And I found out I knew more than they did . @(Footage-of-Abramso) @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Here is the proof that he 's lying . @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) Abramson says judges have gotten better over the years . But prosecutors , she says , have gotten worst . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : The prosecution 's only interest is not in justice , is not in guilt or innocence . It 's in getting a conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ab-so-lute-ly . Few and far between are the prosecutors who really are concerned about whether the person they 're prosecuting is guilty or innocent . You hear about it occa ... @!GOLDBERG : Leslie . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : And I -- I 've been in this business 27 years -- 27 years . I have won a string of cases of innocent clients , clearly innocent clients ; prosecution push -- pushes harder . @!GOLDBERG : You 're sort of suggesting that the defense lawyers are the noble ones in this whole process . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Absolutely . @!GOLDBERG : Re ... @!Ms-ABRAMSON : You laugh . Now what right do you have to laugh ? @!GOLDBERG : I -- I -- I 'm only laughing -- I -- I 'm ... @!Ms-ABRAMSON : You 're -- you know , you 're -- you 're -- because what you are doing is -- your laughter is precisely why the public believes the opposite . @!GOLDBERG : Let -- let me -- let me tell -- no , I 'm sort of reflecting the public 's view , not creating it . @!Ms-ABRAMSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no basis to know one way or the other until you tell them about it . @(Footage-of-police-) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) And to Leslie Abramson , one of the reasons cops lie and prosecutors only care about winning is because we Americans have become so sick of the bad guys , that we do n't care if the good guys cheat . To this liberal defense lawyer , the real problem is a right-wing America . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Is n't the real story here that America has drifted so far to the right , that law and order -- those philosophies of law and order , ' convict at any cost ' ... @(Footage-of-prisons) @!Ms-ABRAMSON : ( Voiceover ) ... ' lock them and sock them , ' ' Who cares if they 're innocent ? ' ' We do n't want any guilty st ' -- is n't that what 's really going on ? Is n't that where America really is , to its disgrace ? @!GOLDBERG : Is that what you think ? @!Ms-ABRAMSON : That 's what I think . @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to get away from being a full-time defense lawyer ... @(Footage-of-light-g) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) ... at least for a while ... @!Ms-ABRAMSON : I 'd do anything not to look like Howard Stern . @!GOLDBERG : ... which is why she 's trying out for a job as a radio talk-show host . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : We should do some testing , see if I 'm too close . @!GOLDBERG : She is also looking for work on TV . The courtroom celebrity , it seems , would like to become a media celebrity , too . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : But wait , let me say something about that . You know , I 'm a lawyer ... @(Footage-of-Abramso) @!GOLDBERG : ( Voiceover ) But whether it 's behind the microphone or in the courtroom , Leslie Abramson has a message which may give you second thoughts about defense lawyers . Problem is , they may be exactly the same as your first thoughts . Our system says you will defend this man accused of murder , and even if he did it , you will give him a zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : Exactly . We do this weird thing . @!GOLDBERG : Exactly . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : We stand up and advocate for people who we know are bad . @!GOLDBERG : Exactly . @!Ms-ABRAMSON : That is our function , and without it , the good would get convicted . @(Montage-of-footage) @!RATHER : Coming up , the latest on Elizabeth Taylor 's condition since the evening news . @(Announcements)

Ms. @!SMITH : Like I said , it does n't matter if he 's drug-free .

She sued the boss she worked for at a Hardee 's franchise , John Herkenraider. @!Ms-WOLFE : @(Voiceover) He just crossed the line . He went from being a demanding boss to a very verbally abusive boss to a boss who would come in and throw things at you . @!Mr-JAY-BYRUM-@1Ter : To be told when she 's seven months pregnant to climb into a Dumpster to find a burnt biscuit , when she 's pregnant to have a -- a tin full of hot baked beans essentially thrown in front of her and she 's showered with baked beans ... qwq @ ( Footage-of-menu ; -H @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) If things were so bad at Hardee 's , why did n't you just quit ? @!Ms-WOLFE : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we could make it .

They both denied the charges and refused to talk with us . But employment lawyer Chris Barraca would . @!Mr-CHRIS-BARRACA-@ : But you 're talking about who 's going to make that judgment of what 's abusive and that 's the problem . @(Footage-of-Barraca) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) He says these kinds of conflicts in the workplace do n't belong in court . @!Mr-BARRACA : The issue is not whether or not any of us want a better place to work , we all do . The issue is really whether or not we want to open up this vast new area of -- of lawsuits in our society . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Hardee ' @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) But Teressa never made it to court . @!Ms-WOLFE : @(Voiceover) When I originally filed this suit , I thought that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would support me in some way . And I found that that support was n't going to be there . They were looking out for their jobs . @(Footage-of-inside-) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Instead , she settled the case for $ 55,000 . And as for John Herkenraider , he still holds the same job at the Hardee 's franchise . @!Ms-WOLFE : @(Voiceover) If I could have made that workplace better for just one other person , then I thought I accomplished something . And -- and I 'm sorry to say I made no difference . qwq @ ( Footage-of-Hardee ' @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) Teressa 's experience shows just how difficult some of these cases can be . So far , no one in West Virginia has taken an abusive boss to trial and won . @(Footage-of-Subey-H) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) In New Jersey , Elaine Subey-Hert hopes to be the first one . @!Ms-SUBBE-HIRT : @(Voiceover) At this point it 's been so long and so hard , and I 'm hoping this -- this will be my closure . @(Footage-of-Courtro) @!MORIARTY : @(Voiceover) But as you 'll see later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setback of her own .
