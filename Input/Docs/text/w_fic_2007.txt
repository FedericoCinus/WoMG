His little pug nose was freckled , and he had reddish hair and dark blue eyes on account of which Miss Smith , his maternal aunt , called him Blue Violet when he was little . " " Now why is my Blue Violet so sad ? " Miss Smith would ask him when he came home from school pouting . His eyes were covered by the large bill of a cricket cap on which the word Massachusetts was written in gaudy red letters . That was the name of the club that John rooted for , because his older brother Alec played for them . And John would answer , without pushing the cap up from his eyes so that Aunt Mary would n't notice his tears , because Johnny was a very short-tempered and disdainful little brat : " Nothing . It 's nothing . " " Then why does n't my Violet want to eat lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then why wo n't my Little Blue Violet admit that he does n't know how much seven times seven is , or twenty-seven minus eighteen ? Why wo n't he admit that he does n't know where the headwaters of the Mississippi are ? " Johnny , however , just sat at the table and said nothing ; he was not going to permit the sun to dry the dew from his eyelashes . He no longer answered in the negative ; he was n't saying anything at all . He was a proud little urchin , and it was only to his mom that he confessed when he had something to confess . That 's why he was silent now . Johnny , a.k.a . Blue Violet , waited for his mom to come home from work . Then , when his mom was home from work , he began , " Mom- " " Oh , Johnny dear ? " And they understood each other right away . " -Mrs . Morgan punished me because I slugged that sneak Horace Greenwood in the nose really hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That she gave me a severe reprimand . And that you have to go talk with her tomorrow or some other time before vacation starts . " Johnny Smith was quite an insolent and candid little brat . That 's why he told his mother everything he was supposed to . After that , he whipped the cap off of his head , the way his older brother had done when he still lived at home , and began to slurp the soup that had already grown cold . At that point , Mrs. Smith , his mother , inquired of him : " Johnny dear , did he call you that name again ? That thing about you being- " " Yes , mother , " Johnny said , staring at his now thoroughly cold soup . " But did n't you promise me ? " " Yes , mother , but I ca n't stand it any longer . I just ca n't understand why he calls me that . That 's why I came back at him with : prove it and he said look at your pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I went off to the bathroom , and in the mirror I saw that Horace was not lying . When I went back to the classroom , I felt as if I were going to cry . Then I looked right at Horace Greenwood and I saw that his pupils were black , too . That 's when I realized that he was picking on me , and so that 's why I popped him one on the snout as soon as Miss Morgan stepped out . Because I realized that he was n't telling me the truth . He did not tell me why they call me that . The thing with my eyes was just teasing . " Johnny was a hard-headed little imp , and that 's why he added : " I will fight every one of them until they quit calling me that . Why have they given me that name ? " Mrs. Smith , his mom , caressed his head gently but also admonished him a bit with these words : " Johnny dear , Johnny dear , how long will we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec , however , explained to him what it was really about . Johnny was only twelve and had already been expelled from school . So Alec said this to him : " Johnny , things ca n't go on like this . You 'll never be a man , for crying out loud ! If you continue to ... You 're not a violet ; you 're a Woolf , a little wolf . " " But why do I have that nickname ? If you tell me , then I 'll give you my word of honor that I 'll never hit anyone else . " " But Johnny-you 're a crybaby . " " All right , then I 'll start fights . I 'll turn into Joe Louis . " " Why Joe Louis , Johnny ? " " He 's strong . The strongest . " " He 's black . " " He 's the strongest . " " But you are n't black . " So then Johnny added : " No matter , Alec , i 'll become black . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? * What will you turn into then ? " " Whatever you want . I 'll enroll in college . " " Should I really tell you ? " " If you know then tell me . Otherwise , Alec , I 'm going to take a bite out of your ear . " " Well , well . Look at you . " " Out with it , Alec . " " How am I supposed to tell you , Johnny , you crybaby ? OK , here goes . One of your grandfathers , actually your grandfather 's grandfather , had negro blood through one of his grandfathers . So there . That 's why . That 's the reason they call you that . Everybody in town knows it . . . . But you , Johnny , are a big wimp , and I never knew how to explain it all to you . . . . Well , it could happennote that I 'm saying " could ' -that your son will be that way , too . A darkie . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . I will finish school and enroll in college . You 'll see . Johnny keeps his word , even though you say he 's a big sissy . You 'll see , Alec . " Johnny was not a crybaby . And he kept his word . He nearly outstripped Alec . Alec explained it away by saying he was always busy with cricket and rugby , but this response was not justified in the least , since Johnny trained as a boxer and still took his law degree after four years . Just one semester behind Alec , even though Alec was three years older . After that he moved to the South and opened up a legal practice . He quickly acquired a reputation as an expert on the problems of black people . He published several highly regarded pamphlets on the segregation of the races in the South , and he led a delegation to President Roosevelt that managed to win some very significant changes to government regulations , including-but not limited to-recognition of the right of black children to receive an education . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his practice as a law clerk . Mrs. Smith could thank none other than " Dr. " Smith for her emancipation . And he could n't have done his job without her . On his thirty-third birthday , three years after their wedding , John Smith mentioned to his wife that he did n't feel well . The night before , at a reception in honor of a visiting delegation from Alabama , he had probably eaten something that did n't agree with him . These damned allergies had hounded him since his college days . Earlier , he 'd been excused from work for three months on account of them , and he 'd also had an exemption from military service , since he was allergic to the uniform and it left his body covered in dark blotches . As soon as he switched to his lightweight workout clothes , the splotches disappeared overnight , so to speak . Nevertheless , they thought now was a good time to contact Dr. Matthews . When the doctor arrived , John Smith was just lying there , drenched in perspiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whites of his eyes had grown yellow and turbid , things that Dr. Matthews interpreted as symptoms of a kind of contagious jaundice that was fairly widespread among the black population but most rare among whites . Dr. Matthews wrote out a prescription and reassured Mrs. Smith . He recommended rest and a strict diet for her husband . As he was leaving . Dr. Matthews added , in an offhand manner : " You should have called me earlier . Now I fear that the treatment is going to take a while . " " But Johnny only fell ill this morning , " said Mrs. Smith . " Last night he was still completely fine , and in a great mood . " Dr. Matthews thought for a moment and then promised that he would come by again the next day . Should the patient be doing poorly in the meantime , his wife should summon the doctor sooner . Regardless of the time of day . He would spare no effort in treating Mr. Smith . Early the next morning , at about four o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the doctor , standing up uncertainly but without removing the receiver from his ear . " I 'll come right away . " Mrs. Smith was n't joking : John Smith , whom they had called " Blue Violet " at home and " Nigger " at school ( when he was a little boy up north ) , was lying there , smiling . He was drenched in perspiration but was apparently cured . Dr. Matthews had to sit down so that he did not betray his astonishment . John Smith , whom the people down there in the South called " Dr. " Smith , had turned into a black man overnight . He died that same day and was buried , with full municipal honors , in the " black " graveyard . It was his wish to be taken there . The entire African American South mourned for him . The well-known Louis Armstrong played some blues for him at the funeral . The final words of the deceased , spoken into the ear of the good Dr. Matthews , were symptomatic of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Matthews guarded the secret with professional discretion . Confident that no one would doubt his report about a heart attack due to a genetic defect and stress at work , Dr. Matthews did not reveal his inability to confirm the real symptoms accompanying this unusual illness and unusual death . He himself was satisfied with the rather general assertion-actually the claim was just a few dim intimations-that there are some conditions and phenomena that operate beyond the framework of the material world . One day , though , when every possible piece of evidence of his helplessness had truly dematerialized , Dr. Matthews made use of an appropriate occasion to pose Mrs. Smith a question : Was she acquainted with anyone named Horace Greenwood ? She answered , however , that she 'd never even heard the name before . This only confirmed the doctor 's suspicion that the late John Smith had been mentally disturbed . For here 's what he had said that day : " That stupid Horace Greenwood is to blame for everything ! " This was , as we 've said , simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course .

##1013951 An Ozark Folktale <p> There once was a girl named Mary Calhoun . She lived with her family near a graveyard in Missouri , in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains . Late one afternoon , her father went for a walk through the cemetery . He stopped to rest on a low stone tomb and watch the sun go down . When he was content , he got up to leave and forgot about the walking stick he had propped against the tomb . Later that night , back at home , Mary 's father remembered his stick . Mary said she 'd go fetch it and be back to the house again in a shake . Out the door she ran before anyone could stop her . When Mary reached the graveyard , dark was already closing around her . She walked briskly among the cold headstones toward the tomb where her father had sat . In the dim moonlight , she saw the walking stick and picked it up . Just then , her foot came down right at the edge of an open grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow , as if dug in haste . Or maybe the ground had caved in after a pine coffin had rotted away . Mary stood staring at the cracks in the dry ground and felt fear quickly overwhelm her . Swift as sin , a bony hand thrust up out of the grave and clutched the hem of Mary 's dress . She dropped the walking stick and started to let out a scream-but no sound would come . Another hand lunged out and clamped onto Mary 's ankle . She wrenched and jerked and tugged , but she could not tear herself loose . Something ancient and decaying climbed up and wrapped its putrid body around her shoulders , and then she could struggle no more . " Walk ! " rasped the creature , expelling foul , clammy breath down her neck . Its voice was like the wind in an old deserted house . Mary Calhoun walked against her will , bound by the eerie power of the thing that held her . Down the lane they went toward houses near a cow pasture . The shriveled thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn at shucking time . At the same time , it was also heavy with the weight of unspeakable evil buried in the cold earth for untold centuries . " I 'm hungry , " rasped the thing , " for I have not et in many a year . Turn in here , " it commanded at the first house . Then suddenly , it rasped , " No ! Turn away ! There 's holy water here . " At the next house , it turned her away again . " No ! " it rasped . " There 's holy water on garments blessed at Mass . " But at the third house , it commanded , " Go in. for there 's no holy water in this house . " Inside , Mary saw the family , whom she knew well , all fast asleep in bed . Somehow time had flown for them but crawled for her since she had stood at that sunken grave . " Go to the kitchen , " said the thing from atop her shoulders . Mary went as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary did as she was told . " Upstairs ! " the voice ordered . Mary went , although unwillingly . In the loft slept three fine sons-Mary 's childhood playmates . " Cut their throats ! " the creature hissed in her ear . With trembling hands and tears in her eyes , Mary touched the shining blade to each pale neck ... then pulled the blade across each tender throat . The first drops of blood fell into the bowl , and each boy twitched . The boys became cold and still as more drops fell . With the last drops , each boy became ashen and died . Mary took the blood in the bowl and returned to the kitchen . " Make gruel. " the thing directed . And she did . When the water boiled and Mary mixed in the oatmeal and blood , the thing commanded , " Serve it ! " Like a zombie . Mary took two bowls and spoons from the cupboard and napkins from the dry sink . She took the lumpy , crimson oatmeal from the stove and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat , " whispered the thing , its voice a hypnotic murmur in her ear . Mary felt the bile rise in her throat . Her hands shook as she lifted a spoon of the bloody gruel toward her lips . The creature drooled and extended its slimy tongue toward the dark red mixture . Mary 's hand shook so violently that the spoonful of gruel fell into the folds of the kerchief she wore at her neck . She lifted the dripping spoon up to her lips . Her jaws moved , and her throat swallowed . The creature snorted in triumph . " Now that you 've et in the house of the dead , you 're one of us ! " The thing slithered off Mary to take a seat at the table , unaware that Mary had not eaten that morsel . When it let go of her garment , the creature 's power over her faded away . Mary was a clever lass . She sat down swiftly and pretended to eat , as if the spell still held her . The thing slurped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary lifted spoonful after spoonful toward her mouth . When the thing was not looking , she deftly dropped each bite into the folds of her kerchief . When the bowls were empty , the thing stood up and said , " We 'll leave now ! " " I 'll just take up the dishes first . " said Mary . She carried the bowls and spoons to the kitchen , took off her kerchief , folded it over the uneaten gruel , and set it in the sink . When she returned to the parlor , the thing slunk up her back again and wrapped its hideous self around her shoulders . The powerful spell returned , and Mary did what the thing bade her . " Back to the graveyard ! " The pair went to the path and passed the houses . " Now you have joined the undead . You can know what we know , " the thing whispered . " That gruel made you one of us , but if any was left and fed to those dead boys , they 'd rise alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " The thing chuckled in delight . As they walked farther along , by the cow pasture , the thing became chatty . " That mound of stones there-I hid all my bags of gold under it ! In life , I took them from anyone who stood in my way . " the voice cackled with pleasure that turned into a whine , " but little good they do me now . " Back in the graveyard , Mary saw that the sun was about to rise . Time had flown again as they 'd eaten their murderous meal . The thing climbed down , and Mary felt the spell fading away . The thing slipped into the cracks in the ground and then turned and reached for her . " Come down , Mary Calhoun , into your new home . Come down into the underland of the condemned . " " I 'll not come down . " cried Mary , " for I have et none of your disgusting gruel ! " The thing let out a scream of rage and began to climb back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight flew like knives over the hills and struck the thing . It groaned and froze still . Mary grabbed her father 's walking stick and started home . She turned in at the third house , where the family was wailing over the boys " fate . " There 's fever hereabouts , " Mary said . " Perhaps they 've only fainted . " " Ay , you 're daft . Mary Calhoun , " said the father of the boys . " I know dead when I see it . " Still , he let Mary go to the kitchen , where she got a bowl of water and the kerchief , as if to mop the boys " brows . Upstairs , she sat down beside their lifeless bodies and spooned the gruel between their lips . With the first morsel , each boy groaned and clutched his throat . The neck of each one healed and was whole again . With the second bite , their eyes flew open , looking dark and wild , as if they had witnessed things that humans had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their eyes cleared , the red returned to their cheeks , and they smiled . With the third spoonful , each boy rose up slowly and shook his head , chasing away the shadows of a terrible nightmare . However , the three boys could still recall the powerful stench of something long dead . The boys looked at one another in wonder and burst into talk about the mystery that had claimed them and then set them free . When the parents heard the voices , they rushed up the steps , hugged their three fine sons , and shed tears of joy . And Mary Calhoun smiled and went home to give her father his walking stick . 
##1013952 Jenna is willing to sacrifice everything to join the cool kids . She just has trouble saying it . <p> Is it wrong to want to be in ? When you 're in , you know where you 're sitting for lunch every day . You know what clothes to wear , what music to listen to , and what movies to like . You know whom to be friends with and whom to ignore . When you 're in. you can stop wondering who you are . Jenna had been wanting in since last summer . She 'd grown taller , leaner , more noticed than before . When September came , she was ready to shed her old image as a desert animal sheds its skin . What better way to shine than to be part of Alison Swale 's in crowd , the six most envied freshman girls at Buckley Academy ? There were three things you had to do to join . First , eliminate your old friends . Olivia was Jen 's oldest and closest . They 'd been pals since preschool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had worked hard to get their daughters into Buckley on financial aid . But lately Olivia seemed less cool to Jenna , more of a drag . Second , you had to delete all the undesirable songs from your iPod and replace them with Alison 's playlist . Jenna had never been that confident about her taste in music . She was happy to let Alison take over . Finally , you had to jinx with Alison . Jinxing meant you were catching on to the group 's unique brand of slang , which was seasoned with words in Italian . ( Alison summered on the Italian coast . ) You never greeted a friend with Hey , You said Ciao plus the person 's name . Ciao , Nellie . Ciao , Sophia . Ciao , Jenna . And you knew when to throw in such words as boffo and fannullone . Jenna had been waiting for just the right moment , and on the day before Halloween , it came . Olivia had overslept , and Jenna caught the bus without her . When her preschool pal finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright orange Crocs . Her waist-length hair , usually brushed to perfection , looked like a willow in a windstorm . The group sneered . " What do we think of Rapunzel 's outfit ? " one of them cruelly asked . Jenna knew the perfect word . She looked at Alison . Alison looked at her . Then , in an apparent reflex , they said the word at the same time . " Schifo . " It was Italian for " gross , disgusting . " " Jinx ! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten , " Alison rattled . " Ca n't talk until I say your name . From left to right , Jenna slid her fingers blissfully across her lips . Because it was Jenna 's initiation jinx , Alison presided over a little releasing ceremony the next day . The six girls sat in a circle , and Jenna sat in the center . Alison produced a pair of scissors , cut a strand of her own hair , and then passed the scissors around . When they had six strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hair , making a single multicolored braid . " Welcome to the group , Jenna Mahoney . I release you from your silence . " " Thank you , " Jenna said . Or meant to say . The words , though clear in her mind , never left her mouth . After school , Jenna walked to the bus stop alone . Olivia caught up to her . " So now I 'm skiffo. is that it ? " Jenna had n't meant to insult her friend . She 'd only wanted to join the group . She knew she should explain it to her , but somehow she could n't find the words . " What , now you wo n't even talk to me ? " Jenna started to say , " Of course , I 'll talk to you . " But nothing came out . " Fine , " Olivia said , tears coming to her eyes . " Ignore me , then . " And she walked off . Jenna turned and saw a homeless woman camped out across from school . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap and a transistor radio on the curb . The back of the radio was open , and Jenna could see that it had no batteries , yet the woman 's entire body bobbed to the music in her head . Her finger swept through the air like a conductor 's baton . It landed on the volume wheel and flicked it down . " Fight with your friend ? " the woman asked . Jenna just looked at her . " You used to dress more like her and walk side by side . Now you 're trottin " in fancy togs . And she 's running off in tears . Why the change ? " Jenna had never seen this woman before . It creeped her out to know that she 'd been watched . " What 's the matter ? Cat got your tongue ? " Jenna nodded . The woman made a wide loop with her baton finger . " Then kill the cat . " she said . Her finger landed on the volume wheel and flicked it back up . The bus was pulling away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the driver to wait , but he did n't hear her . A man sat on the bench next to her . " Excuse me , " Jenna said , " what time is it ? " He opened his newspaper and began to read . " Sir ? " she said . He did n't look . Why is n't he answering me ? Jen wondered . The bus driver 's window was open . Why did n't he hear me ? She tried humming a song but could n't hear her own voice . She touched her finger to her throat and felt for the vibration . Nothing moved . It was as though some invisible hand had reached in to the place where all her sound came from and pinched it still . It gets dark early on Halloween . As Jenna trudged up the long , steep hill toward home , she could see lights on in other people 's houses , where children were eagerly climbing into their costumes . Soon they 'd be climbing into cars , and their parents would be driving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer . At home , Jenna checked her e-mail and found one from Alison . The subject line read " Party Plans . " Jenna felt a flutter of anticipation . This would be her first party as an official member of the group . She opened the e-mail and read " 9:00 at my house . I 'll provide the costumes . " Jenna clicked Reply and typed " Sounds boffo . I 'll be there . " A minute later , a response came from Alison 's iPhone . " Ca n't read your message . Are you Mac or PC ? See you tonight . A. " Jenna looked at the screen . Under Alison 's response were the words " original message " followed by a colon . After the colon was a string of odd symbols-the computer junk that shows up when a message ca n't get through . Jenna suddenly worried that if she could n't speak , she could n't ask her parents for a ride to the party . She grabbed a piece of paper and a pen . In clear block letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the letters landed as mere shapes : circle , rectangle , triangle , triangle , triangle . In a panic , she pulled the Scrabble set onto the floor . She threw off the lid and grabbed the pouch of letters . I 'll use them to make words , she thought . I 'll start by spelling HELP . She dumped the tiles onto her bed and began turning them over . A sick feeling came over her as she stared at the little wooden squares . They were all blank on both sides . From downstairs , her mother 's voice . " Honey , we 're going . " They were headed to the annual Grown-ups " Halloween Party in Studio City , Olivia 's parents would be there too . NO ! DO N'T GO ! Jenna cried out in her head . There 's something wrong with me . I ca n't speak ! " If you need anything , call us on my cell . " Jenna looked out the window and saw her parents heading down the block , Dracula and his bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't as if she could pick up the phone and order a cab . And she was n't about to walk all the way to Alison 's house in Beverly Hills . Not on Halloween . Not alone . She made sure the front door was locked and chained . She decided she would watch an old movie on TV. but all she could find were movies she was too scared to watch alone . The Exorcist . The Shining . Carrie . Jenna worried , suddenly , that if something happened , if someone tried to break in , she 'd be trapped If you ca n't talk , how can you call 911 ? If you ca n't talk , how can you scream ? Outside , the street was quiet and still . Yet where the street ended , the sounds began . Jenna could hear the October owl that always hooted after nightfall . She could hear coyotes yipping at the moon and rustling through the brush , looking for food . The sounds creeped her out , so she buried her head under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer sound woke her . The doorbell . And voices . " Trick or treat ? " Jenna looked at the clock : half-past nine . Who comes this late ! she wondered . Not kids . Not this far up the hill . The bell rang again . " Jen , you there ? " Alison . Jenna opened the door . Alison stood smiling on the front porch . " You never showed up . We were worried about you . So we came to make sure you 're OK . " She stepped aside , and Jenna saw a white limo parked in front of her house . The whole tribe was there , all wearing Venetian masks , their heads poking out of the windows and up from the sunroof like flowers arranged in a vase . " Can you even guess where we 're going ? " Alison enticed . Jenna shook her head . " My dad got us backstage passes to Maroon 5 . Come on . I brought you a mask . " She handed her a green one with black and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girls in the limo and waved them over . As they poured out of the car , Alison explained . " We ca n't go to the concert on empty stomachs . We 'll hunt for candy first . " Jenna wished she could explain that it was too late to go trick-or-treating . Especially here in the hills , where almost no one came . Most of the houses were already dark , the people either out or home in bed . " Does n't that girl Olivia live around here ? " Alison said . Jenna nodded . " Show us which house . Maybe she 's home . " Jenna looked out at a sea of painted smiles . With their masks on , she could n't tell who was who . They were moving like a single person , with a single purpose . If Jenna had known the purpose , she never would have opened the door . " The concert starts at 10 , " Alison said casually . " We 'll skip the warm-up band . " She pointed to a shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives ? " Jenna turned her head from side to side . " Keep walking , then . We have n't got much time . " Halfway down the next block , they came to Olivia 's . The front window was ablaze in a blue light . The television . Olivia had never been afraid to watch alone . " Ring the bell , " Alison said . " Let 's see what kind of candy she has . " There was an odd tone in Alison 's voice . It put a sick feeling in Jenna 's stomach . " Oh , " Alison went on , " put your mask on first . It 's Halloween , after all . " She put on her own mask , white with black leaf-shaped eyes and blood red lips . Jenna just looked at her , feeling paralyzed . Alison took the extra mask out of Jenna 's hand and placed it on her head . " Cara Jenna , " she said , " there are three things you had to do to join us . And you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do in order to stay . As soon it 's done , we 'll go to the concert . I know you like Maroon 5 . They were the only band I did n't tell you to delete from your iPod . " There was a chorus of giggles from behind . They sounded like the coyotes still yipping in a distant canyon . " The bell ? " Alison said . Jenna put out her finger and pressed it . A light came on . A voice called out . " Who 's there ? " " Trick or treat ! " Alison sang . The door opened , and from behind her mask , Jenna saw Olivia 's face . It too looked painted , in an expression of surprise . As soon as Olivia turned away to get the bowl of candy , the whole tribe pushed into the house , sweeping Jenna along with them . The girls formed a circle and pushed Olivia into the center . Then Alison dragged Jenna into the middle too . From under her cape Alison brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed cold and hard in her palm . A pair of scissors . Two of the girls grabbed Olivia 's arms . One grabbed her hair . Her hair that she 'd been growing since third grade . Her hair that was her pride and joy . Her hair that Jenna used to brush for her . under tents made from blankets and chairs . The rest of the girls began to chant : " Rapunzel , Rapunzel , let 's cut off her hair . Rapunzel , Rapunzel , let 's give her a scare . " Alison guided Jenna toward Olivia , whose head was jerking back and forth between the two hands that held the two sides of her hair . So this was it , Jenna thought . A final wail to step over , a little higher than the one before . " After this , " Alison whispered , " you 're in forever . " It was just hair , after all , was n't it ? Olivia 's grew fast . It would grow back . Besides . Jenna was wearing a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenna raised the scissors and opened their blades . She hesitated as she looked into her friend 's eyes . She had never seen Olivia scared . Maybe that was the real difference between them : Olivia had always been fearless and Jenna always afraid .

##1013954 PARLEZ-VOUS FRANAIS ? VICTOR RODRIGUEZ DOES N'T . BUT THAT DOES N'T STOP HIM FROM SPEAKING UP IN FRENCH CLASS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL TO IMPRESS A GIRL <p> The smalt , triangle-shaped campus bustled with students talking about their new classes . Everyone was in a sunny mood . Victor hurried to the bag lunch area , where he sat down and opened his math book . He moved his lips as if he were reading , but his mind was somewhere else . He raised his eyes slowly and looked around . No Teresa . He lowered his eyes , pretending to study , then looked slowly to the left . No Teresa . He turned a page in the book and stared at some math problems that scared him because he knew he would have to do them eventually . He looked to the right . Still no sign of her . He stretched out lazily in an attempt to disguise his snooping . Then he saw her . She was sitting with a girlfriend under a plum tree . Victor moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie . When the bell sounded , Teresa looked up , and their eyes met . She smiled sweetly and gathered her books . Her next class was French , same as Victor 's . They were among the last students to arrive in class , so all the good desks in the back had already been taken . Victor was forced to sit near the front , a few desks away from Teresa , while Mr. Bueller wrote French words on the chalkboard . The bell rang , and Mr. Bueller wiped his hands , turned to the class , and said , " Bonjour . " " Bonjour , " braved a few students . " Bonjour , " Victor whispered . He wondered if Teresa heard him . Mr. Bueller said that if the students studied hard , at the end of the year they could go to France and be understood by the populace . One kid raised his hand and asked , " What 's " populace ' ? " " The people , the people of France . " Mr. Bueller asked if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress Teresa . The teacher beamed and said , " Trs bien . Parlez-vous Franais ? " Victor did n't know what to say . The teacher wet his lips and asked something else in French . The room grew silent . Victor felt all eyes staring at him . He tried to bluff his way out by making noises that sounded French . " La me vave me con le grandma , " he said uncertainly . Mr. Bueller , wrinkling his face in curiosity , asked him to speak up . Great rosebushes of red bloomed on Victor 's cheeks . A river of nervous sweat ran down his palms . He felt awful . Teresa sat a few desks away , no doubt thinking he was a fool . Without looking at Mr. Bueller , Victor mumbled , " Frenchie oh wewe gee in September . " Mr. Bueller asked Victor to repeat what he said . " Frenchie oh wewe gee in September , " Victor repeated . Mr. Bueller understood that the boy did n't know French and turned away . He walked to the blackboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel-edged ruler . " Le bateau , " he sang . " Le bateau , " the students repeated . " Le bateau est sur l'eau , " he sang . " Le bateau est sur l'eau . " Victor was too weak from failure to join the class . He stared at the board and wished he had taken Spanish , not French . Better yet he wished he could start his life over . He had never been so embarrassed . He bit his thumb until he tore off a sliver of skin . The bell sounded for fifth period , and Victor shot out of the room , avoiding the stares of the other kids , but had to return for his math book . He looked sheepishly at the teacher , who was erasing the board , then widened his eyes in terror at Teresa who stood in front of him . " I did n't know you knew French , " she said . " That was good . " Mr. Bueller looked at Victor , and Victor looked back . Oh please , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wash your car , mow your lawn , walk your dog-anything ! I 'll be your best student , and I 'll clean your erasers after school . Mr. Bueller shuffled through the papers on his desk . He smiled and hummed as he sat down to work . He remembered his college years when he dated a girlfriend in borrowed cars . She thought he was rich because each time he picked her up he had a different car . It was fun until he had spent all his money on her and had to write home to his parents because he was broke . Victor could n't stand to look at Teresa . He was sweaty With Shame . " Yeah , well , I picked up a few things from movies and books and stuff like that . " They left the class together . Teresa asked him if he would help her with her French . " Sure , anytime , " Victor said . " I wo n't be bothering you , will I ? " " Oh no , I like being bothered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside her next class . She smiled and pushed wisps of hair from her face . " Yeah , right , bonjour , " Victor said . He turned and headed to his class . The rosebushes of shame on his face became bouquets of love . Teresa is a great girl , he thought . And Mr. Bueller is a good guy . He raced to metal shop .

Ms. Morello : Chris , are you paying attention ? Narrator 2 : Ms. Morello was teaching algebra . Back then , none of it made sense to me . Ms. Morello ( to Chris ) : If 9X + I =91 , what does X equal ? This should be simple . Narrator 1 : In my school , students got recognized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually somewhere in the middle . Chris : Twenty-nine ? Ms. Morello : Twenty-no ! Greg ? Greg : X equals 10 . Ms. Morello : Correct . Narrator 2 : Show-off ! Scene 2 Narrator 1 : Thankfully , the bell rang . I was about to leave . But Ms. Morello blocked me at the door . Ms. Morello : Chris , I need to talk to you . Chris : Yes ? Ms. Morello : You realize this week is our pizza competition , right ? Chris : I know . Narrator 2 : Every year , the math classes at Corleone competed to win pizza for the whole class . It was everybody 's favorite day . Well , besides the last day of school . Ms. Morello : I would like to see our class win . But in every chain , there 's a weak link . Chris , that weak link is you . Chris : I 'm trying ! I just ca n't seem to get algebra .

What 's going on , Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming up . We do n't have a chance at winning if I do n't raise my test scores . Do you think I could get an algebra tutor ? Mom : You do n't need a tutor . Did you know your grandmother was an algebra teacher ? Chris : I forgot ! Do you think she can work with me ? Mom : Work with her ? Oh no . You 're working with me . She taught me everything she knows about algebra . I know algebra like the back of my hand ! Narrator 2 : 1 knew that hand well . It would probably end up smacking my head .

Scene 5 Narrator 1 : The next day , mom started tutoring me . My biggest problem was n't algebra . It was figuring out how to quit getting yelled at .

That 's the difference . Narrator 2 : A couple of minutes later , things still were n't going so well . Mom : That 's wrong ! Narrator 1 : They only got worse . Mom : Are you crazy ? Narrator 2 : And worse . Mom : What kind of answer is that ? Narrator 1 : My mother had accomplished the impossible . She made algebra even harder ! Chris : Maybe grandma can help me . Let 's call her . Mom : No . Look . When you multiply on one side , you have to multiply on the other side . Chris : Can we please take a break ? Mom : OK . I think we 're getting closer . I can feel it ! Narrator 2 : With pizza on the line , there was only one thing left for me to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother . Grandma : Chris ! What are you doing here ? Chris : Hi . Grandma . I need your help . Grandma : What 's the problem ? Chris : Mom + me + algebra = Help me . Grandma ! Scene 6 Narrator 2 : My grandmother was better at teaching math .

Grandma : No . It 's the seventh . Chris : Wednesday ? Grandma : Thursday . Chris : Five o'clock ? Grandma : Six fifteen . Pizza is not the only thing you wo n't be getting if you do n't pass this class . You can barely count your own change . I do n't know how to get you to understand algebra . Narrator 1 : I knew it was time to look at my watch . Chris : How much longer do we have to work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd say a lifetime . Why do you ask ? Chris : The Mets are playing in an hour . Grandma : So you like baseball ? OK . In yesterday 's game . Darryl Strawberry had three hits in six.at bats . What was his batting average ? Narrator 2 : Somehow , baseball helped . It became easier to work out the problem . Chris : X equals Darryl 's number of hits , which is three . Y equals his number of at bats , which is six .

I 'm done with my homework . Mom : But we still need to study for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I got it . Thanks . Mom : Just let me know if you need any more help . Narrator 2 : I waited for mom to leave . Then . I quickly snuck over to my grandmother 's house . Scene 8 Narrator 1 : I was n't sneaky enough . Mom followed me to grandma 's house .

Mom was at the door ! Grandma : Rochelle ? Mom ( confused ) : Hi , Mom . Chris ? What are you doing here ? Narrator 1 : Mom saw the math textbooks on the table . Mom : Chris , how come you did n't tell me ? You got any other tutors on the side ? Narrator 2 : Mom was starting to lose it . Chris : I 'm sorry . Mom . But . I had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Grandma : Rochelle , all you did was holler at the boy . Mom : Is that what you told her . Chris ? Grandma : He did n't have to tell me . I know you . You 're impatient . You could n't teach a rock how to hit the ground if you dropped it . Mom : If he did just what I said , we would n't have a problem . Are you trying to say that I do n't know what I 'm doing ? Grandma : Do n't ask me . Ask Chris . Narrator 1 : Not only was grandma helping me with math she was helping me get killed , too . Mom : Chris , look me in the eye and tell me I was n't helping you . Chris : You were n't helping . Mom ( hurt ) ' . Oh . OK . I guess I 'm going home , then . Scene 9 Narrator 2 : I came home and found my mother in the kitchen . She was angrily mashing potatoes . Chris : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : Mom mashed the potatoes even harder . Mom : I 'm not mad at you . I 'm mad at myself . What was wrong with the way I was teaching you ? Chris : I do n't know . It 's not important . Mom : It was important to you . Chris : I 'm sorry . I really do appreciate your help . It 's not like math is the only thing you 've taught me , anyway . I 've learned a lot from you . Mom : I just wanted to be able to help you . So how 's it going ? Chris : Better . Mom : Better is not good enough . Narrator 2 : Mom called grandma . A few hours later , I was sitting with both of them reviewing algebra . Grandma : Looks like somebody 's going to get pizza tomorrow ! Scene 10 Narrator 1 : It was pizza day . Ms. Morello graded my test in front of the class . I could almost taste the sauce and cheese . Narrator 2 : It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized for doing something right at school . Ms. Morello : Chris , you got every single answer wrong . Chris : WHAT ? Narrator 1 : My classmates started chanting , " Boo ! " Chris : But how could I get every single answer wrong ? There must be some mistake ! Ms. Morello : There was . Unfortunately , you made it . You answered question one on line two . So all the answers that followed were wrong . If you had n't done that , you would have had a perfect score . Narrator 2 : Just then , a delivery guy appears at the door . Pizza Guy : Is this the room where the pizzas go ?
